77,"Projekts: Privātā bērnudārza ""Saulīte"" dibināšana","In this Master thesis author examines her own invented Project “Establishment of company “Zeltnamiņš” LTD”. The idea of this project is to create a new and competitive company in Kurzeme, which will be located in a quiet, beautiful and packed area 10 km from the largest city of Kurzeme, called Liepāja. The core business of the company is planning the provision of accommodation and catering services. The main objective of the project is to create a company that is capable of being competitive, recognizable and sustainable in a given region. In order to achieve this goal, the author sets out the tasks to be performed by the company: performing services in high quality, creating new jobs, providing workers with a good and secure working environment, developing rural tourism in Kurzeme. The creation of such a guesthouse is up-to-date as, according to data from the Master thesis, it was concluded that demand for accommodation was increasing every year. Three individuals plan to set up the company “Zeltnamiņš” LTD. The share capital will be EUR 147 500 and will be divided into 100 parts, with a nominal value of EUR 1 475 per share. Owner A will invest EUR 9 800, as well as property and new building house which will be equipped for the guesthouse at the time of the project, with a value of EUR 120 000, where the owner will own 88% of the share capital. The owners will invest cash in the equity capital of B and C, each EUR 8 850, where the two owners will own a 6% share of the share capital. And the share capital will be paid in full until the company applies for registration in the Enterprise Register. When assessing the forms of a commercial company, the most appropriate commercial company is a limited liability company, since the company is founded by 3 members, the share capital must be at least EUR 2 800, and the owners are not liable by their own personal means and properties, which means that the owners of the company do not have the risk of losing their assets and properties, because the liability is limited to the property of the company.For company “Zeltnamiņš”, financial forecasts and plans were created for the first three years of operation. The financial assumptions in the form of financial plans and forecasts were that during this period from July 2020 to December 2023 the legislation and legislation would not be changed, as well as value added tax would remain unchanged at 21%, whereas even the employer's national social security minimum contribution rate would be 24,09% and the risk fee of EUR 0.36 per employee. In financial plans, the corporate income tax is not calculated because, in the first 3 years of the operation, no dividend costs are provided. For company “Zeltnamiņš”, a profit and loss account, cash flow and balance sheet were prepared for the period from July 2020 to December 2023.Master's thesis consists of 91 pages, which include 27 tables, 9 images and 10 annexes.",0
78,"Projekts: Uzņēmuma SIA ""Zeltnamiņš"" izveidošana","The idea of the project is to create a limited liability company  „G&K STONE”. The company's core business will be to offer granite and quartz stone processing and assembling up to a fully finished product as per customer's wishes. The company's core business will be  twinkled directly to stone surfaces for kitchens, bathrooms, bars and table tops, windowsills, etc. The future plans of the newly created company are to gain a stable market place in the Latvian market, and then start offering their products for export outside Latvia, in neighbouring countries. For a successful, earning and innovative company, the most important is a business idea capable of bringing development opportunities in the future. The product that the company intends to offer is a very high-end quality from granite or quartz material, that gives a new and fresh view to housing. The high quality of the product is provided by the material itself as a raw material from which work and decorative surfaces will be constructed, as well as by manufacturers' professional handiwork during the material processing phase. The idea of the project is based on the creation of a small workshop with materials, tools and all the necessary conditions for quality work and material processing. In recent years, demand for production offered by G & K STONE has increased, which could be explained by increased welfare levels as quality of life indicators improve. This is: the average income of the population increases, material deprivation decreases, the working conditions of Latvian residents and housing conditions improve. Statistics show that the average income of the population is gradually increasing over the last few years, so that the purchase of such high-quality and high-quality products is becoming real for a larger number of consumers. It should also be mentioned that this business idea is largely related to the real estate development sector. Mostly, consumers are eager to install new work surfaces of a kitchen installation in their new housing. In the light of all the above information, the author of this business idea seems realistic, possibly with a potential view in the future. In author's opinion, this is a modern product with high growth opportunities. Demand for this type of product will only become more popular and more in demand over the years. As well as over time, the company's development will make it possible to offer a lot of different products from this material. The production site of the G & K STONE product will be in Gulbene, Lika Street 16. This will also be the company's legal address, at this location will be managed company's core business, the production process, and all production resources. Finished products will be stored for the customer until the product is installed at the customer's facility.

80,"Projekts: Uzņēmuma ""VICIZOO""dibināšana","The aim of the master's thesis is to establish the project ""ViciZoo pet store in Olaine"". The author has chosen this project theme because there is a lack of pet stores in Olaine, but the number of pets in Latvia is increasing and there is a demand for pet store goods. A large part of the Latvian population has at least one cat or dog. These statistics do not include other domestic animals such as rodents, fish or birds, nor do they include the actual number of domestic animals, as one household listed in the above statistics could have a cat and a dog together or more than one cat and more than one Dog. The above statistics also only apply to registered pets, but many households do not register their pets. The statistics also do not include animals that live on the street and are often cared for by people buying them cat and dog food. It can therefore be concluded that the actual proportion of households and people caring for animals is much higher than in official statistics. This indicates a high demand for pet and zoo goods in Latvia. This business is attractive for the following reasons. People love animals very much, and now in Latvia the majority of the population has a favorite pet, but in addition to home, people also take care of animals at work (for example, guard dogs) and street animals. A pet store is a business that sells several types of goods, and the person who bought the animal in the store immediately becomes a regular customer, because this pet needs food and other accessories. This type of business does not require a large investment to open a store and do business.",0

The methods reviewed, such as ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX and VAR, where applied in forecasting Volkswagen stock prices exploring the data for a time period from year 2009 to year 2019. In order to take into account market trends, models where adjusted and supplemented with two exogenous variables – company’s Porsche and company’s BMW stock prices for the above-mentioned period.

Results show that none of the reviewed models was able to show forecasting precision of less than 6.5% in absolute value without additional improvements.

In order to be successful in touring up to 7 people groups accompanied by a guide, it will be necessary to purchase 8 electric scooters “KICKSCOOTER ES1” produced by Ninebot by Segway, which will be the only fixed assets of the company. The vehicles of the particular model were selected because one can be charged to go on for a such distance, as the length of the journey is planned, they can be remotely set to the maximum speed and the battery is placed in the steering structure, which provides a longer lifetime than if it is placed under the scooter. In addition to the technical parameters mentioned above, these scooters are used by companies that provides the rent of the electric scooters in Riga. In accordance with 2nd version of NACE classification “Riga electric scooter tour” Ltd., type of activity is 79.90 “Other reservation services and related activities.” In Latvia over the last five years, the number of companies of this type has increased by 40%, meaning that demand for non-standard booking services will increase, as companies offering travel office services have decreased over the period considered. The number of foreign travellers in Latvia has increased by 25% over the last 5 years, but the increase in the number of multi-day travellers in Latvia is less rapid. During this period, however, the proportion of multi-day travellers staying in Riga and suburb accommodation has increased significantly, and in 2018 they represented nearly 90% of all multi-day travellers in Latvia, that confirms that mostly tourists are concentrated in Riga and its surrounding. If in 2016, on average, a multi-day traveller stayed in Latvia for nearly 5 days, in 2018 it were only 4 days, indicating that travellers choose to spend shorter time, so it is important to offer them services that do not take much time but provide unique experience from the destination.
