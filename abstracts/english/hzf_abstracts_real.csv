2,Autonomā vācu valodas apgūšana studentu vidū,"This thesis is dedicated to the study of autonomous learning of the German language among students. This study is motivated by a direct experience of author during Erasmus exchange program, where students had necessity to learn German language and communicate in intercultural environment. As a result, the possibilities, and ways of language learning among students, as well as the autonomy in this process, were thoroughly examined.

In particular, little is known about their goals, preferences, and favorite techniques and strategies. The aim of the study is not only to determine the methods students use to learn the German language, but also to find out how effective self-study is and whether it is more popular than learning a language with a teacher or in language courses. In order to achieve this goal, the study and review of the scientific and methodological literature was conducted in the theoretical part. The practical part consists of examination of the results, obtained from the survey among 125 international students learning German.",0

4,Spāņu valoda Latvijā: Latvijas iedzīvotāju lingvistiskā attieksme kā faktors valodas izplatībā,"In Latvia, a country with strong political and legal support for strengthening the state language, one of the largest languages in the world - Spanish – also enters on a certain historical and geopolitical background. The master's thesis studies the linguistic attitude of the Latvian population towards a foreign language, including learning Spanish. Analytical, descriptive and comparative method is used in the work, for data analysis - two surveys and several structured interviews with industry specialists. There is a generally a favorable linguistic environment for learning Spanish in Latvia - it is possible to learn it in general education schools, language courses, private language centers. It is also possible to obtain an official proof of the knowledge of Spanish at the DELE examination center. However, the prevalence and popularity of the Spanish language is not as high as it could be in Latvia, based on the findings of the study. Lack of information, lack ofunderstanding of educational laws or linguistic prejudices may be an issue, with English being the priority foreign language in most schools. Spanish could become an equal competitor of English in the system of foreign languages to be acquired, moreover, the regulatory framework of the educational process does not stipulate that English is a compulsory foreign language. Higher education would also require a bachelor's program in Spanish, which would ensure the continuity of the educational stages by preparing highly qualified and professional language specialists in Europe's multilingual environment. Key words: Spanish, state language, foreign language, language attitude, education system, normative acts, teaching.",0

7,Tulkošanas metodes un subjektīvisma faktors daiļliteratūras tulkošanā,"The literary translator may also be regarded as a co-author of the work, since neither the excellent knowledge of languages (both source language and target language) nor the use of the same translation strategies guarantees the same outcome (target text). In the translation of fiction or literary works the translator's subjectivity factor is the key. The translation into the target language is influenced by the translator's knowledge of languages, language sense, vocabulary, linguistic richness, the experience of the translator, his or her knowledge of the country, environment, culture, people, including courage and daring, the ability to identify with the author of the work. These are all considered to be subjective indicators that cannot be measured according to certain criteria. This work looks at different translation strategies and approaches, both from a theoretical point of view and by analysing their application in the two translations (performed independently from each other) of the autobiographical novel “Becoming” of the former first lady of the United States of America. As a result, there are clear indications of the inevitable effect of the subjectivity factor in literary translation.",0

18,Eifēmismu tulkošanas stratēģijas tiesu diskursā,"The interaction between the languages and the legal systems of contact languages takes place in a variety of ways, including culture-specific elements to understand words and word groups that define specific concepts for a specific country and culture. Different strategies are used to achieve this goal: transliteration, i.e. imitation of words in Latvian or Russian (depending on the translation direction), calking, or translation of each part separately, and descriptive translation. Who is the recipient of the translation? This question is important because the answer to it depends on the choice of vocabulary. If the translation is intended for, for example, a philological journal, the interpreter will choose style records that differ, for example, from where the translation is intended for the wider audience. This choice depends on the strategy and translation algorithm chosen by the interpreter. Cognitive information in these types of texts is specific to the terms. Some of which are known not only for lawyers and field professionals but also for native speaker.  Translation of legal texts is a set of rules, means, types and techniques to be used for successful intercultural communication in the field of judicial knowledge, regarding the knowledge of legal terminology and the different styles of legal texts in source language and destination language.",0

This paper examines scientific language elements in Randall Munroe’s collection of popular scientific articles “What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions” as well as the most effective methods for translating and adapting it into Latvian. The translation of 2988 scientific language samples lead to a conclusion that terminology and syntax should mostly be translated directly or by loaning to accurately convey specific constructions and terms, but modulation should be used to improve fluency. Adaptation should be used rarely, as most scientific concepts are known cross-culturally.",0

I study leadership through the lens of practices, looking at practices that shape the nature, direction, and change of the specific organization, and the relationships these practices are embedded in.

A common definition of space is unproblematic, in contrast to its theoretical explication. Until the 20th century, the concept of space has not been sufficiently studied, but with the Spatial Turn the situation has changed – space has become a cultural dimension, which allowed expanding the horizons of its study.   Over the past decades, a large number of works have been devoted to the study of the concept of space, which proves its relevance to this day. This study is dedicated to semantics of the artistic space, that is, its meaning and significance in the novel by the German writer Theodor Fontane, Effi Briest.

The study is carried out with the method of close literary analysis of two novels in the context of exile literature studies.

By addressing the issue of identity in exile experiences Agate Nesaule attempts to re-think her life of a Latvian exile woman in America and to reconnect it with the memory of the place to which she belonged and from which she was exiled. The theme of the Latvian exile experiences and memories discussed in the novels by Agate Nesaule significantly contributes to the understanding of exile experiences in the wider historical contexts of the 20th century and to the studies of the literary forms, such as semi-autobiographical novel, that tell their readers about the memories and traumas of exile displacements and experiences.",0

The topicality of this thesis is due to the fact, that nowadays Shinto funeral traditions are considered unique and little is known about these rapidly disappearing rituals in contemporary Japan where Buddhist traditions are dominant. The Emperor of Japan is one of the few, for whom Shinto funerals are organized. For this reason, Emperor Hirohito’s funeral in 1989 serves as a valuable resource for understanding Shinto traditions.

85,Kultūras iespaids uz plastiskās ķirurģijas izplatību Dienvidkorejā,"The aim of the bachelor's work “The Cultural Impact on the Distribution of Plastic Surgery in South Korea” is to clarify the impact of South Korea's culture on the distribution of plastic surgery in the national internal market, and the feedback effects of plastic surgery, potentially leading to changes in the perception of the values of life. Achieving such a primary job goal requires understanding plastic surgery as the nature and causes of the affecting cultural cornerback that made South Korea the world's center of plastic surgery. Consequently, the total content of the work, which includes the research analysis process intended to achieve the above objective, is structured in four parts with the chapters included therein and presented on 43 pages, not including a description of the list of literature used by the author, a summary of the content with its English translation and a documentary page intended for the submission of the bachelor's work. In the opinion of the author, the subject of the work is now up to date and will become the most pressing in the near future. More and more people are turning to cosmetic surgical procedures. The main problem is that the urge to change is influenced not by the thoughts and desires of the person, but by society, social life and mass media. The above-mentioned impact factors highlight stylized and, mostly, unattainable body types, both in women and men they seek to achieve, despite not only potential health damage and other complications, but also the potential negative outcome of probability in their outside appearance changes. There is a belief that a person who has undergone aesthetic plastic surgery cannot stop after one operation, thereby rapidly developing the view that plastic changes lead to physical dependency. However, the leading point of the study of the author of the work is to overturn the above-mentioned claim by the assumption that the dependency factor of the first procedure is derived from the psychology of the patient itself and is not directly associated with the physiological effects of plastic surgery.",0

157,Ziemeļkorejas totalitārais režīms: cīņā par izdzīvošanu,"The topic of this bachelor’s thesis is “North Korean Totalitarian Regime. Determined to Survive.” Nowadays, the issue of North Korea is being discussed and debated more and more often. Until the 1970s, North Korea was much more economically developed than South Korea, but in the 1990s, Kim Ilsong’s carefully designed and built system began to collapse. The US government and many researchers and observers predicted that the North Korean regime would not survive and collapse in the near future, but, despite all problems, it still remains in force and poses a threat to other countries, while other similar regimes either changed out of recognition or collapsed. The emphasis in this paper is on the internal analysis of the regime and the study of internal political tools and instruments used by the North Korean government to ensure its power in the country, the internal stability and continuing survival of the regime against all the obstacles that it constantly faces.  The thesis is divided into two main parts. The first part provides an insight into the origins of North Korea's totalitarian regime, as well as the main features of totalitarianism. The second part examines and explores the methods and tools used by the North Korean government to secure its totalitarian power in the country. It also takes a closer look at the period from the 1990s to the present, in order to trace changes in government measures to maintain power in the wake of North Korea's rapid economic downturn and the collapse of the original political control system. It was concluded that although the regime had lost initial control over society and society’s faith, it managed to subordinate the population and ensure stability by increasing repression and militarization of the state. The regime remains to be at the totalitarian stage and ensures hegemony over society, thus, the internal stability of the regime is assured and the economic crisis has not led to its collapse.  Keywords: totalitarianism, North Korea, tools for maintaining power, domestic politics",0

176,Ķīnas Tautas Republikas dzimstības un ģimenes plānošanas likums - cēloņi un sekas,"Bachelor’s thesis “Elements of Taoism in Acupuncture” is devoted to the beginnings of Chinese healing, the explanation of Taoism and acupuncture as a part of Taoism. The main topic of the paper is: the concept of Taoism in acupuncture.  Taoism is a system of faith and philosophy that can be regarded as one of the foundations of Chinese culture. Taoism has emerged circa IV-III centuries B.C., however taoism is also closely associated with more ancient beliefs - the theory of holism, alchemy, etc. It cannot be denied that, in such a long period of time, the Chinese cultural heritage is permeated with elements of Taoism. Chinese traditional medicine had evolved under the strong influence of Taoism, formulating its own characteristic view of therapeutic methods. Nowadays acupuncture still remains an actual topic. In the world, there are always cases when doctors, for different reasons, recommend to use traditional medicine remedies and methods, rather than those of conventional modern medicine. In modern era of globalization, interest in traditional medicine methods, including acupuncture, is growing not only in China, but also elsewhere throughout the world.  The aim of this work is not to dispel the criticism of the traditional medicine methods of treatment, but to consider traditional Chinese medicine as an important aspect of culture, which, in particular, was influenced by Taoism.  The first part serves as an introduction to Taoism and a brief description of main concepts behind it. The paramount concept of Taoism is tao - the path, source and principle of the cosmic order, the flow of vitality. De often refers to the activity that is manifested in the tao. The third guiding principle is wuwei, which could be interpreted as “For everything it is necessary to understand when to stay passive”. The second part of this thesis is focused primarily on analysis of the theories of traditional Chinese medicine, such as:  holism, the five element, the qi energy, xue, yin-yang, and zang-fu theories.  The closing, third, part is devoted to method of acupuncture and its analysis. Acupuncture began to take shape more than 2500 years ago and was constantly evolving since. The methods of acupuncture are based on acupuncture point – “acupoint” activation with a needle. In a broad perspective, Chinese acupuncture treatment aims to unblock the meridians (jingluo) - channel network through which the life-energy known as ""qi"" flows, increase blood circulation and qi energy flow, as well as harmonize the yin and yang elements.",0

185,Kolektīvā rakstīšana akadēmisko kompetenču attīstībā,"Collaboration is an important part of education. One of the most widely praised and studied collaborative learning approaches is collaborative writing which is often used in language courses. Academic writing is an integral part of higher education and developing academic literacy skills is crucial in ensuring successful academic performance. Although the importance of academic literacy is undeniable, there is limited research available on the influence of collaborative writing on students’ academic literacy. Therefore, the goal of the present research is to explore the effectiveness of collaborative writing in academic literacy development. To reach the goal, a case study was conducted, involving an experiment and a questionnaire. The participants of the study were 12 first-year undergraduate English philology students. During the experiment, students individually and collaboratively produced comparison/contrast paragraphs. The analysis of the student paragraphs revealed that collaborative writing is an effective activity when it comes to producing texts of higher formality as well as in constructing proper paragraph structures. However, it showed little effectiveness in increasing the lexical density or length of a paragraph. The results of the questionnaire suggest that students have an overall positive attitude towards collaborative writing. The findings of the study lead to a conclusion that collaborative writing is effective in improving some aspects of academic literacy, while ineffective in improving others.",0
