Firstly, the prohibition on the employer to suspend an employee for more than three months.

102,Līgumtiesisko un delikttiesisko prasījumu konkurence.,"In every legal system, which distinguishes between contractual and tort liability, competition of claims may arise – situations in which, for the same infringement, the claimant may seemingly claim both contractual and tort liability. This problem is of considerable practical importance because the consequences of applying each type of liability may vary. However, neither in Latvian legal literature nor in case law has this matter been analyzed in depth.

104,Autortiesību aizsardzība interneta vidē.,"The paper provides research about copyright infringements that have occurred in the internet. Technologies developing rapidly across the world, faster than lawmakers are able to realize and regulate it, the Internet is one of these technologies. Beneficiaries are different people, for example copyright holders, who use internet as platform to pursue their civil rights, but at the same time a place where others can easily infringe rights of copyright holders - authors. For this reason, copyright holders may have limited opportunities, for example, to generate income, because significant proportion of consumers choose to acquire the works like music and movies illegally – downloading or to watch a stream.   The aim of the paper is to find a solution to quickly and effectively prove copyright infringements in court and what changes the legislator should implement to help copyright holders to exercise their right to copyright protection as guaranteed by The Constitution of the Republic of Latvia. Solutions would help to prove copyright infringements not only in internet, but also in real life.  The results obtained show that the copyright holder can prove copyright infringement in the internet by proving that particular infringement was committed from particular internet protocol address assigned to defendant. However, defendant can object, that defendant didn’t commit infringement because defendant was elsewhere on the basis of the location data of defendant’s mobile phone, cumulatively with some other evidence, supporting defendant’s objection. The copyright holder may attempt to prove that defendant has manipulated location data.  The current framework in Civil Procedure law states that only a case judged in criminal proceedings relieves plaintiff of the burden of proof, but this not the same with rulings of proceedings of administrative violations process. If legislator changed the framework in Civil Procedure law and Administrative Liability law, relived plaintiff of the burden of proof, also in administrative violations process. That would make easier for copyright holder to get remedies of infringed copyrights and other victims, thereby promoting fast and effective court proceedings.  Key words: copyright protection, proof, internet, internet protocol address, location data, principle of procedural economy.",0

106,Mantojuma tiesību zaudēšana.,"There are two ways in which a person voluntarily may lose his or her inheritance rights - 1) by entering into an inheritance waiver agreement; 2) rejecting the inheritance. It is important to distinguish between these two types, because their nature, the period of time, the subjects are quite different, but often they are mixed. The heir can both- reject and accept the inheritance in silence. Consequently, without including a list of certain activities that would testify to the acceptance of the inheritance in silence, the legislature, with the words “in silence accepted or rejected inheritance”, has created a general clause allowing each case to be dealt with separately. People often believe that ignoring the inheritance, automatically rejects the inheritance. In turn, in all cases, it does not lead to the rejection of the inheritance. Consequently, the person, without knowing himself, has accepted the deceased's inheritance. The goals of the research: 1) to analyze each type of voluntarily lost inheritance rights, to understand their main differences, the consequences; 2) to find out the opinion of society and the level of knowledge in the inheritance rights, as well as to compare it with the experience of professional and their opinion.

As a result of this case study, the author establishes an invariable fundamental principle regarding succession to state responsibility: predecessor-state does not transfer its international responsibility to the successor-state. However, in practice two exceptions to the principle of non-continuity of responsibility can be identified: a voluntary declaration by the successor-state to take over the obligations of the predecessor-state and some specific cases in which an international court or tribunal establishes a transfer of state responsibility on the basis of a close link between the conduct in question and the successor-state.",0

111,Pēc mantojuma atklāšanās dzimušu bērnu mantošana.,"Article 386 of the Civil Law of the Republic of Latvia states that a person may inherit if at the time of opening of inheritance they have been conceived but not yet born.

138,Nodarbinātības tiesiskās formas un nelegālās nodarbinātības problemātika.,"In the bachelor's thesis “Employment Legal forms and Issues of Illegal Employment” were analysed the most widely used forms of employment of a natural person in the Republic of Latvia, such as employment relationships, company agreement, copyright agreement and others, with an objective to identify the characteristics of which one form of employment is distinguishable from one another. Considering that persons are basically employed on the basis of the Labour Law of the Republic of Latvia, a comparison is made in thesis on how to separate employment relationships from other types of legal relationships. A proper separation of legal relationships is necessary, since in practice employers may be interested that the actual employment relationship is concealed as another type of employment relationship because of the reduction of the tax burden. Although tax laws provide for such a situation and the classification thereof is often carried out by supervisory authorities in favour of employment relationship with a contract between parties, the failure to conclude a contract of employment in written form is still a widespread violation. On the other hand, it should be noted that there should also be no unjustified classification of any contract concluded by the parties on the basis of their free will for the sole benefit of employment relationship. In the bachelor’s thesis the regulation of the Civil Law, the Labour Law and other laws of the Republic of Latvia, as well as international regulatory enactments and the case-law of the Republic of Latvia were analysed. Comparative method was broadly used in thesis to look for features that are common and different to different employment legal status. In the summary of thesis, the conclusions state that the existence of a set of characteristics of employment legal relationships gives priority to recognise specific employment relationship directly as legal employment relationships, contrary to the status of other legal relationships. The contract of employment shall also be in force without it being drawn up in writing, considering that the parties of employment relationship can provide the characteristics of the legal employment relationship. Consequently, the absence of a written form constitutes as an administrative violation which does not terminate the obligations already established between parties, but requires the employer to draw up the legal relationship in written form.",0
