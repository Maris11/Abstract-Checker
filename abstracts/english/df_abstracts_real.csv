39,Bioloģiskās kustības sintēze un izpēte klīnisku datorizētu testu nolūkā,"The human mind and its visual system are able to distinguish perceived information and divide the objects into biological (e.g. human) or others. The thesis discusses the human visual system’s ability to recognize biological creatures with a minimal number of stimuli on the screen (as stimuli representing light dots). This kind of stimuli (i.e., biological creatures represented by some eventually very few light dots) is called biological motion. The ability of human visual system to recognize biological motion is used in clinical tests. For people with neurological diseases this ability is weaker. As a part of the study, a web application was developed. In the web application there are available different kinds of biological motion animations. The web application measures time that is needed to recognize biological motion. The results of the study suggest that biological motion recognition is significantly dependent on age. Increasing age corresponds with increasing time  that is needed to recognize biological motion. The recognition of biological motion does not significantly depend on the width of a device (physical resolution of a device) or gender, although women have greater average time needed to recognize biological motion. The experimental group (people with brain damage) did not complete each subsequent test task with the same time improvement effect as the subjects in the control group did.",0

48,SwiftUI salīdzinājums ar iOS12 skatu izveides tēliem iOS lietotņu izstrādē,"Smart device usage these days is very common in our daily life. Most important interaction point between software and its user is user interface. Interface that we see in our smart devices is made from multiple views, which can be developed in different ways. User interface development is very important, because it attracts users attention, allows easily and intuitively use software and encourages user to return. Until 2019, when highest iOS operating system version was 12, view creation was based on two main principles – view creation with interface builder and view creation from source code. View creation with interface builder uses auto layout paradigm, which automatically calculates objects size and constraints, but when creating view from source code, we can use both auto layout and frame-based technique, which draws view in specific size and coordinates, and doesn’t create mutual relations between visual objects. Master thesis discuss iOS view creation patterns and libraries, which list was added by Apple Inc. in end of 2019 by completely new library – SwiftUI. Thesis discuss libraries basic principles, advantages and disadvantages and view creation principles. One view in real time iOS application was implemented in 3 ways – with SwiftUI, using interface builder and with writing interface from source code. All these solutions were compared by work capacity, performance and maintanability. When measurement process was finished and conclusions were made, it came clear that right now UIKit usage is more comfortable and takes less time for development for experienced developer, but no doubts, that iOS view creation future is SwiftUI, which is faster, easier to read and by default uses more capabilities then UIKit based project.",0

This document explores the possibility to retrieve data from relational databases using R2RML and visual queries, by using OBDA approach. Different available tools will be analyzed to see if it is possible to look at relational databases as RDF graphs and query them using textual SPARQL query language. To find a solution for the previously described problem, this document examines different platforms and tools, that allows using visual semantic queries for data retrieval from relational databases.",0

125,Droša datortīklu transporta protokola izstrāde,"The theme of the bachelor thesis “Development of safe and secure network transport protocol” was chosen based on the author's existing experience working in an autonomous machine development environment. In stand-alone machine communication networks, packet delay and packet loss at the reception and transmission of data are not expected. Under heavy load conditions, the Linux OS kernel does not handle receiving and transmitting an intensive datagram flow. Applications of autonomous machines may need to send or receive information for up to 30 applications in parallel. Autonomous machines and support infrastructure are powered by computers with limited resources. They need a secure transport protocol that reduces delays in sending and receiving datagrams, is resource-limited and can multiplex data applications between multiple applications. The protocol will be developed based on the UDP protocol and OS kernel bypass methods such as DPDK and Netmap. By combining the best ideas from existing industry transport protocols - TCP, CoAP, QUIC, RTP, etc. - a transport protocol was developed to provide a solution to the above problems. The developed protocol can be used on limited computing resources, can transmit multiplexed data, which provides parallel data transmission.",0

134,GDPR piekļuves tiesību sistēma UBER platformai,"General Data Protection Regulation (further – GDPR) is a regulation which aim is to secure and govern the personal data privacy. Regulation came into force on 25th May of 2018. All the companies which maintain European citizens data were forced to follow a new set of rules. One of them was rights of access. Rights of access play one of the central roles in the GDPR. It gives data subjects rights to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data. UBER is taking a leading position in the word in the transport industry. UBER gives its user ability to arrange and schedule transportations. To maintain such high position in market UBER is forced to process and analyze terabits data daily. Due to UBER operates with personal data and works also in Europe it must follow all GDPR list of rules. To help UBER maintain GDPR rights of access set of rules was designed a rights of access system for UBER platform because existing way of processing customer right of access request was considered as outdated due to processing was made manually. Rights of access system inherits all principles, technologies and design concepts from existing UBER platform architecture. UBER platform has wide description of used architecture available publicly on the Internet. Right of access system was designed in a fault tolerance and easy scalable manner. System guaranties that no requests will be lost during the processing and end users will receive email replies in a predefined time. Scalability was achieved by using dynamically changeable configuration file for exporting user information. This provides ability to change table columns, names and table quantity from which exports should be made. Configuration file can be changed in system runtime without a need of redeployment of existing system. Request sending feature will be available in UBER mobile and web applications only for registered users. UBER platform does not store information about users whose accounts were deleted. Responses on customer requests will be available for end user via their email which is mandatory provided during registration process in UBER platform. Rights of access system was designed and partly developed on a voluntary basics.

148,Kvantu meklēšanas stacionāro stāvokļu apraksts,"Quantum walk search is a search algorithm based on classical random walk, in which a marked vertex is sought in a structured database -- a graph. It is known that in many cases quantum walk can find the marked vertex in time $O(\sqrt{n})$, while classicaly $\Omega(n)$ time is required. If the quantum walk's starting state is roughly the same as a stationary state, the quantum algorithm does not achieve a better time complexity than the classical one. Thus the existance of stationary states, depending on the graph and marked vertices, is researched.  In this work we research quantum walk search using Grover's coin and its stationary states -- cases, where the walk leaves no impact on the state during its application.  A solution is known for the existance of stationary states in the case of all marked vertices forming one connected component and all unmarked vertices forming another connected component.
