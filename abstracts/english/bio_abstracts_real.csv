1,MUSKUĻAUDU OKSIGENĀCIJAS PARAMETRU IZMANTOŠANAS IESPĒJAS ANAEROBĀ SLIEKŠŅA NOTEIKŠANĀ BMX SPORTISTIEM,"BMX (Bicycle Motocross) is a specific type of cycling and became more popular when it was included in the 2008 Olympic Games program. The sport is sprint-type and very explosive and requires versatile training from athletes. The main goal of the study is to evaluate the functional parameters of BMX cyclists' physical performance by comparing the results of muscle oxygenation change in the increasing load test obtained with the Moxy device with the results of the cardiopulmonary exercise test.. A group of BMX athletes was selected to perform the VO2max test with increasing load to failure. The results showed the athletes' heart rate and blood pressure at exercise, as well as the athletes demonstrated their aerobic and anaerobic abilities. Information was collected and BMX sports were characterized and compared with the results of other types of cycling, such as MTB (Mountain Bike) and road cycling athletes. The study highlights the uniqueness of BMX in athletes' physical fitness and competition. The data show high anaerobic performance and good performance after the anaerobic threshold. The study concluded that BMX athletes have good recovery abilities and that they can develop maximum power in a shorter period of time much better than other cycling athletes. Gear transmission is very important for developing and maintaining maximum power. However, due to the specifics of the load in BMX sports, it is difficult to make accurate measurements and adapt the laboratory experiment all close to BMX sports conditions, so finding and using an alternative device in the real environment could give us a much deeper understanding of BMX athlete physiology.",0
2,Dzīvesveida paradumu ietekmes izvērtējums uz kardiometabolo saslimšanu risku pieaugušiem cilvēkiem.,"Cardiometabolic diseases are among most significant causes of mortality in the world, and, since they are largely preventable, widely accessible methods for reducing cardiometabolic risk and identifying the risk factors are needed in order to ensure effective prevention measures. The aim of this bachelor’s thesis was to evaluate the significance of the effect of lifestyle factors on the development of cardiometabolic risk development. This study involved 65 adults within the range of 30 to 54 years old. Anthropometric measurements were acquired via self-reported anthropometry and the evaluation of lifestyle factors was based on a survey, which was sent to every respondent individually, following an invitation to participate in this study. Anthropometric data was used to calculate the values of cardiometabolic risk factors. The statistical analysis of the data consisted of correlation and covariation analysis. The obtained results allow to conclude that lifestyle factors, which show significant adverse effects on the development of cardiometabolic risk in a relatively small study population (n=65), are smoking and consumption of alcohol.",0
4,Pesticīdu izplatība hidroekosistēmās un to potenciālā ietekme uz ūdens organismiem,"Global consumption of  pesticides is very high. Due to their widespread use, pesticides enter the aquatic ecosystems and are common in the environment. Pollution from pesticides attracts the attention of researchers, as these pesticides can have a significant impact on aquatic ecosystems and consequently animal and human health.  The objective of this study is to determine the potential effects of widespread pesticides on aquatic organisms. Using two biotesting methods: the microalgae growth inhibition test and the acute crustacean immobilization test. In addition to biotesting, survey was conducted to interview farmers, to learn their used pesticide use justification and storage. During the experiment, the EC50 – effective medial concentrations and LC50 – sublethal concentrations, LOEC - the lowest exposure concentrations at which inhibition of test organisms was observed and the NOEC - the highest concentrations at which no effects on test organisms were observed were determined during the tests.  Experimental results show that all selected pesticides have high toxicity. Highest toxicity in daphnia tests was shown by the insecticide “Proteus OD”, which unfortunately is widely used in the fight against insects, and in the algae tests the herbicide “Broadway Star” (see conclusions).  Pesticides with several active substances were found to contribute more rapidly to the inhibition of aquatic organisms than pesticides with only one active substance. Tested zooplankton organisms showed greater sensitivity to pesticides than phytoplankton organisms. Pesticides that enter water bodies can cause both microalgae un crustaceans’ demise, especially in waters bodies near agricultural land. Farmers emphasize that the use of pesticides is necessary to increase production efficiency and promote farm development.",0
5,Brūnkakļa Aythya ferina izplatības un skaita izmaiņas Latvijā 1958-2019,"The assessment for the European Red List of Birds 2015, has indicated that in the last 20  years there has been serious reductions in the distribution and abundance of breeding Common  pochard Aythya ferina, resulting in the European population being upgraded from IUCN Least  Concern status to Vulnerable. In this study we created an overview of the pochards distribution  changes in Latvia by using bird atlas data from three time periods: 1980-1984; 2000-2004;  2013-2017. To evaluate changes in abundance we used data from two long term waterbird  studies in Lake Engure (1958-2019) and Lake Kaņieris (2005-2019).  Our atlas analysis indicate that in in the last 33 years species distribution has lessered  signifficantly. Also the breeding population in Lake Engure since the end of nineties has  experienced a dramatic decrease. Reason for it is a mix of factors – loss of breeding habitat,  decrease of black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus colonies, and increase in predator, especially  American mink Mustela vison, numbers. In our opinion, it is valid to asses these limiting factors  to the general breeding pochard population in Latvia. Meanwhile, in the last 14 years breeding  population of pochards in Lake Kaņieris has stayed relatively small, but stable.",0
6,Ekstracelulārās vezikulās ietvertās mikrobiālās RNS atklāšana cilvēku asins un urīna paraugos,"According to numerous studies, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by almost all cell types within human body and act as mediators of various biological processes via cell-to-cell communication. Recent studies show that intercellular communication is possible between human microbiota and host cells as well. In this study, we show that EVs isolated from human blood and urine contain RNA fragments derived from various microorganisms. The most commonly represented phyla and superphyla in blood and urine were Proteobacteria, PVC group and Terrabacteria. To determine if the major source of these microbial transcripts is gut microbiome, we developed a method for the isolation of EVs from human stool samples. Next, we plan to perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of EVs isolated from plasma, urine and stool from the same individuals.",0
7,Cilvēka herpesvīrusa-6 U12 un U51 gēnu kodēto proteīnu iespējamā loma autoimunitātes attīstībā,"HHV-6 is an omnipresent pathogen which can establish lifelong persistency in its host and is linked to the development of multiple diseases, among them – autoimmune. Although the link between HHV-6 and autoimmune thyroid disease has been shown, mechanisms elucidating how HHV-6 influences the onset of autoimmunity remain unclear. HHV-6 possesses a number of immunomodulating properties, which are used to manipulate the host immune system for viral evasion and dissemination.  The role of HHV-6 encoded viral chemokine receptors U12 and U51 in the development of autoimmunity was evaluated by using potentially immunogenic synthetic peptides designed from viral amino acid sequences. Peptide immunogenicity and antibody cross reactivity was evaluated using suspension multiplex immunological assay. HHV-6 was detected in all of the patient’s thyroid gland samples (64/64, 100%) and in 37 of them an active HHV-6 infection was found (37/64, 58%). The expression of HHV-6 chemokine receptors U12 and U51 was detected in 23 of the patient’s thyroid gland samples (23/64, 36%). Samples positive for viral chemokine receptors expression had significantly elevated viral loads (p=0,0155). HHV-6 peptide specific IgG and IgM antibodies were found in patient’s samples, with higher signals for IgM antibodies, which is indicative of reactivation and active HHV-6 infection. No cross reactivity between HHV-6 peptide specific antibodies and human recombinant CCR1, 3 and 5 was found. Further research is necessary to determine the immunogenicity of HHV-6 gene U12 and U51 encoded proteins.",0

Bref s.l. root rot causes serious economical losses in European Union, about 790 million euros per year. To limit the spread of root rot in Latvia coniferous stumps over 10 cm in diameter are being protected from Heterobasidion spp. infection using biological control agent containing P. gigantea spores. Previous studies have shown that natural P. gigantea infection is not sufficient to effectively control Heterobasidion spp. prevalence in pine stumps. To determine Heterobasidion spp. and natural P. gigantea development in small diameter, different height pine stumps, in three plots 300 pine stumps were analysed, half of them 15 cm high and half – 50 cm high. 120 stumps in two sample plots were treated with Heterobasidion spp. spore suspension and 180 stumps were left untreated for natural Heterobasidion spp. and P. gigantea infections. To analyse mycelial growth all stumps were cut into 2 to 4 cm thick discs (down till root collar).  We determined that in this study P.gigantea natural infection was significantly more prevalent than Heterobasidion spp. natural infection – in only 3% of both treated and untreated stumps after 22 month long incubation period viable Heterobasidion spp. mycelium could be found, but P. gigantea had spread trough 39% stumps. Therefore natural P. gigantea is a significant factor to control Heterobasidion spp. infection in small diameter pine stumps.  Stump height did not significantly influence the development of natural P. gigantea in small diameter pine stumps, but the incubation period did. Compared to results obtained after 22 months, after 28 months the average area colonised by P. gigantea was significantly lower. From all stumps infected by P. gigantea (n=115) in 62,5 % of analysed 50 cm high stumps and in 76,0% of 15 cm high stumps mycelium had spread untill the root collar of the stump. In further reasearch stumps containing viable P. gigantea mycelium could be excavated and their root system analysed to determine the importance of natural P. gigantea in limiting Heterobasidion spp. secondary spread.",0

11,Tetrazola analīzes izmantošana orhideju un ziemciešu dzimtas augu sēklu dzīvotspējas noteikšanai,"The determination of the viability of seed with non-differentiated embryos (dust seeds) is complicated due to the small size of seeds and the dependency of seed germination on symbiotic microorganisms. The aim of this work was develop optimal viability testing method using tetrazolium chloride for seeds of different species with non-differentiated seed embryos. According to the purpose of the work, the tasks we-re: to determine the viability of the seeds of certain species of the Orchidaceae family and Pyroloideae subfamily  using tetrazolium chloride test, to examine the effect of pre-incubation in sucrose solution on the activation of the metabolism of the seeds pri-or to the tetrazolium test, and to determine the proportion of germinating seeds in in vitro conditions. The tetrazolium chloride seed viability test is based on the colouring of viable seed cells as a result of the activity of dehydrogenase enzyme. Before colou-ring the seeds with tetrazolium chloride, they were disinfected in sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution, which is at the same time chemical scarification of the seeds, with or without prior incubation in sucrose solution. In order to check the effects of chemi-cal scarification on the test results, the duration of disinfection was modified. A spe-cialised N1 medium and Murashige & Skoog medium, supplemented with yeast extract, was used to test seed germination in vitro. Scarified seeds were incubated on the nutrient medium in aseptic conditions. The seeds were germinated at +22 °C with or without prior incubation at +5 °C. The seed activity was determined once a week for 16 weeks by counting the protocorms and separately counting protocorms with developed rhizoids. The percentage of viable seeds determined by the tetrazolium test in different scarification treatments was compared with the protocorm count on the medium. The effects of yeast extract concentration on the protocorm development was tested .",0
12,NaCl un smago metālu sāļu ietekme uz piekrastes mitrāja auga krastmalas skābenes Rumex hydrolapathum augšanu un jonu uzkrāšanos,"The aim of the study was to determine tolerance and ion accumulation of Rumex hydrolapathum plants in the presence of NaCl and heavy metal (cadmium, chromium, nickel and lead) salts. The plants were cultivated in an automated greenhouse where they were treated with different concentration of the respective substances, and leaf chlorophyll concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured. After harvesting ion analysis was performed in dried plant parts. R. hydrolapathum avoided ion accumulation in young leaves in all treatments. However, the maximum ion accumulation occurred in old leaves for Na, Cd and Ni, but for Cr and Pb in roots. From the changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence the growth of plants could not be predicted. R. hydrolapathum could be potentially used for soil remediation polluted with NaCl, cadmium and lead.",0
13,Miega kvalitatīvo rādītāju novērtējums pēc sirdsdarbības frekvences miegā un kortizola koncentrācijas dinamikas.,"Sleep deficit and disruption can lead to multiple negative outcomes on human health. While self-reported sleep quality assessment is subjective, it can be assessed by sleep stages and hormone concentration changes. Sleep stages have qualities reflected on continuous heart rate measurements. Cortisol is one of the hormones which diurnal cycle is influenced by sleep processes. The aim of this work was to find out heart rate and cortisol dynamics’ connection with sleep quality. The study had 10 voluntary participants within ages 20-23. They filled Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and chronotype questionnaires. Each participant measured their heart rate for three nights, with addition of collecting urine samples for determination of cortisol concentration for each night. Results show a connection between high and low heart rate variability interval length ratio and sleep quality, that could be explained by slow wave sleep stage effect on sleep quality. Morning cortisol levels and higher evening cortisol levels tend to be in association with lower sleep quality values.",0
14,Pericentriskā heterohromatīna loma genoma telpiskajā organizācijā un regulācijā krūts vēža diferencēšanās komitācijā,"The aim of the study was to define possible structural and transcription changes of pericentromeric heterochromatin (PHC) at early stage of the differentiation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells activated with heregulin (HRG). In activation model the changes of transcription dynamics of early stress response genes and pericentromeric satelite DNA were determined in MCF-7 cells after HRG treatment by using qPCR. PHC topology and organization were defined with immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy and image analysis methods. It was discovered that PHC clustering is proportional to count of centromeres and their layout is defined by power-law. HRG causes rapid de-clustering of PHC. From collected data a hypothesis was posed that PHH de-clustering in cells committed to differentiation cancels its negative position effect, allowing the whole genome transcription activization.",0
15,"Oksidatīvās fosforilēšanas sistēmas funkcionalitātes novērtēšana, izmantojot citoplazmātisko hibrīdu šūnu modeļus","Five enzyme complexes that are located within the inner membrane of the mitochondria compose oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. The OXPHOS system produces up to 90% adenosine triphosphate in cells. OXPHOS system disorders caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders. There is no single specific method for mitochondrial disease diagnostics. The effects of pathogenic mtDNA mutations can be studied using cytoplasmic hybrid cell models. The aim of this work was to evaluate the functionality of OXPHOS system in the cytoplasmic hybrid cell line control group and in a patient cell line with a possible pathogenic mtDNA mutation. A group of control cell lines was established and the OXPHOS enzyme activities were determined, the protocol of cell viability measurements was optimized and the control group cell viability was determined, a cell line harbouring the m.14894T>C mutation was characterized and analyzed, and the frequency of mutation m.14894T>C in the healthy Latvian population was determined.",0
16,Drosophila melanogaster cerebrālās asimetrijas attīstība un organizācija,"Right-left asymmetry is a common feature of the nervous system in vertebrates and invertebrates. Cerebral lateralisation are essential for animal cognition, its disruption can cause neurological disorders such as speech impairment in humans. Several genetic and environmental factors play an important role to its origin, however, the underlying mechanisms of asymmetrical organisation is unknown. This study shows the developmental and circuit organisation of asymmetrical body (AB) in the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. Single cell clones and activity dependent synaptic connections generated in this study demonstrate anatomy of various AB neuronal types and constitutes their precise wiring circuit. During early pupa development occurs break in symmetry and then the AB establishes anatomical asymmetry which persist throughout adulthood.",0

18,Sterilu jaunu radioaktīvu peptīdu sintēze un to pretvēža aktivitāte in vitro sistēmās,"NET tumors are the most common oncologic disease out of all cancer types. Brest cancer, which is one of NET types, is the most common oncological disease amongst women with hundreds of thousands of new cases every year. Since the end of last century radiopharmaceuticals are used for diagnostic of tumours and their metastases in clinical practise. In the last few years a new approach have arised in ocology – theranostics – diagnostic and therapy with tumor specific peptide that is labelled with radionuclide.  HA-DOTA-TATE (somatostatin analoge) labelled radionuclides opens door for affordable theranostics for patients. But there are lack of studies about how good or bad HA-DOTA-TATE affinty to SSTR is. That is why this study was performed. Using three cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SkBr3 and MCF-7) and dermal fibroblast cell line HDFa as control 68Ga and 177Lu labelled HA-DOTA-TATE affinity was measured in those cell lines. Results show that radiolabelled HA-DOTA-TATE have potential to be used in both therapy and diagnostic of NET tumors.",0

The effect of dendrological parameters and fertilization on vegetation and its provision of ecosystem services in short rotation coppice. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of fertilizer (sewage sludge and wood ash) on birch and grey alder height and diameter, vegetation and ecosystem services in birch and grey alder stand provided by short rotation coppice. The plantation is located in Skrīveri district in “Pardenči”. Trees were planted in 2011. Four blocks were created. Each of them consisted of control plots and plots fertilized with sewage sludge and wood ash. Vegetation was described in plots. Data about plant species found in birch and grey alder stands were summarized for each sampling time. The survey was conducted from the third to seventh year after planting. The height and diameter of trees was measured to estimate the effect of fertilizer type on tree growth. In the fourth year after planting there were no significant difference between the number and cover of herbaceous plant species and the type of fertilizer (analysis of variance p values 0.08 and 0.09). In the seventh year after planting, fertilizer (sewage sludge) influenced birch and grey alder height and diameter. Species diversity in the plantation decreased from the third to the seventh year after planting. Birch stands had higher number of herbaceous plant species.  In both of the studied tree species plots, two natural grassland indicator species were found: Dianthus deltoides L. and Dactylorhiza maculata. (L.) Soó. There were found also two invasive plant species: Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl. and Solidago canadensis L. The highest number and cover of leguminous plant species were found in the birch stand. Using data from literature the amount of sequestered nitrogen from the atmosphere by Trifolium pratense L. was estimated to be 79,968 kg N2/ha in the third to seventh year after planting, respectively. Also, the number of nectar plant species was higher in the birch stand, reaching the highest level in the fourth year after planting (13 species). In the seventh year after planting there were eight nectar plant species.",0
20,Lapsu (Vulpes vulpes) un jenotsuņu (Nyctereutes procyonoides) endoparazītu daudzveidība Latvijā,"There is a little reseaches about wild mammals parasite diversity in Latvia. The aim of present study is to determine the prevalence and endoparasites diversity of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Latvia in the time period from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016. In the study, it was found that the most common endoparasites in red foxes were Alaria alata (94.2%) and raccoon dogs Uncinaria stenocephala (93.7%). Analyzing the closeness of the association between parasite species, it was detected that there is a moderate association between the parasite species of red fox lung nematodes Crenosoma vulpis and Eucoleus aerophilus, which tends to be positive. It was also found that the parasitofauna of red foxes has higher diversity (H=1,67) comparing to that in raccoon dogs (H = 0,47). The age of the red fox was an affecting factor for the presence of endoparasitic species such as Molineus patens and Istmiophora melis. It was determined that the diversity of red fox endoparasites is not affected by the animal population density, but in raccoon dogs a strongly negative correlation was found between the animal population density and the calculated endoparasite species diversity index.",0
21,"Eiropas un Baltijas plekstu Platichthys flesus un P. solemdali atšķirtspējas novērtēšana, balstoties uz morfoloģiskajām pazīmēm","It was previously considered that the flounder has two reproductive strategies – with pelagic and demersal eggs. In 2018. on the basis of genetic research, it was found that they actually are different species. Previously described European flounder (Platichthys flesus) spawns pelagic eggs, which require water salinity above 11 ‰ to succesfully reproduce. Demersal spawning flounder was named Platichthys solemdali, whose egg development requires a lower level of salinity (about 7 ‰).  As Latvia is one of the leading countries in flounder fishery, and potentially both species may inhabit its waters, it would be necessary to find out which of the flounder species (or both) are present in Latvian waters. It would also be important to carry out flounder stock assesments, as different species may have different stock development trends depending on the environment. For this study five places were chosen, where P. solemdali and P. flesus would theoretically have different stock proportions – the open sea (Ventspils and two near Liepāja), Irbe Strait (Kolka) and the Gulf of Riga (Saulkrasti). Morphological parameters were measured for the samples collected and compared to perviously available data. Results of this study conclude that it is not possible to distinguish the two species using only morphological features. Future studies could be continued by comparing morphometric results to flounder age and genetically confirmed species.",0

Events to increase the population of river lamprey have been taking place already from the middle of 20th century – the translocation of spawners over migration obstacles and stocking of artificially bred larvae. The events are taking place in rivers that already have an existing population of them with the purpose to increase the population, or they are stocked in a river section selected by superficial ecological evaluation. In order to make these events more efficient, it would be necessary to select the lamprey stocking sites by more various criteria. Macrozoobenthos often is used as a biological indicator of waterbody quality assessment. The aim of this study is to identify macrozoobenthic organisms that could be used to determine the optimal river site where to place population multiplying events. The benthic macrofauna samples were taken in 13 streams and 20 sampling sites. The samples were sorted and identified to the most precise taxonomic rank possible. The indicator values of macrozoobenthic taxa were calculated in relation to lamprey larvae presence, then significance and importance of said values were analysed in different scales. By comparing obtained indicator values with the taxa correspondence to the ecology of lamprey larvae, it has been determined which macrozoobenthic taxa presence or absence is the most significant. 77 statistically significant indicator values were obtained. Of them five – Corixidae, Crambidae, Caenis horaria, Platambus maculatus, Radix balthica – were recognized as important indicators, which are to be considered when selecting stream sites in future for releasing river lamprey larvae.",0

The study analysed changes in leukocyte biomarkers - mtDNA copy number and telomere length - and the possible effects of patients' habits and other influencing factors. The results showed that MDR-TB patients had an increased mtDNA copy number and a reduced telomere length compared to controls. Significant changes were observed only among men. Biomarkers were also affected by smoking, duration of TB treatment and the number of doses received. Several mtDNA variations were identified that could be associated with TB and treatment-related adverse effects. The results indicate a more rapid immunosenescence among MDR-TB patients that may affect the function of immune system.",0

The aim of the study was to investigate the possibility to produce biomass of two probiotic Lactobacillus strains using whey as a substrate and to test the survival of this biomass in curd and cottage cheese to evaluate the possibility of developing a new type of probiotic product. The effect of lactose concentration on the growth of these strains was assessed. The growth parameters of these strains were studied on sweet and sour whey and compared to the indicators in the MRS medium, and the biomass viability in curd and cottage cheese was assessed.  During the study, pH changes, lactose consumption and lactic acid production were evaluated.  Looking at the effect of different lactose concentrations on both strains - Lactobacillus casei-01 optimal lactose concentration value ranges from 30 g/L to 60 g/L but L. casei subsp. rhamnosus only 20 g/L. The highest biomass productivity and yield in whey substrate was observed after 24h of fermentation. Lactose consumption and lactic acid production during fermentation were also studied. The highest results were shown immediately after 24 hours, after 48 hours productivity decreased. In both skimmed and whole milk curd, both probiotic strains retained viable cell counts above 106 CFU per gram of curd for at least 7 days and in cottage cheese for at least 8 days at + 4 °C. Both types of whey have been found to be suitable substrates for Lactobacillus casei-01 and Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus biomass production, and comparing both types of curd with cottage cheese, cottage cheese had higher survival rate with both strains. During the study essential experimental methods were mastered: bacteria cultivation methods, biomass determination with spectrophotometer and multimode microplate reader – incubator, lactose determination with HPLC chromatograph and colony forming unit calculations.",0

In the Master's thesis, the phytoplankton indicator “Diatom / Dinoflagellate index” (Dia / Dino index) was tested in the Gulf of Riga, and the influence of physical (temperature) and hydrochemical (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon) parameters was determined on spring diatom and dinoflagellate maximum biomass and index values. The index values were calculated by separating the transition (T) and open, coastal (O-C) parts of the gulf. The data on phytoplankton and physico-chemical parameters from 1976 to 2019 available in database of the Latvian Institute of Hydroecology were used. Dia / Dino index from the average and maximum biomass of spring diatoms and dinoflagellates, as well the alternative silicon consumption index have been calculated and the threshold values of good environmental status (GES) have been determined. In the course of the work  was found out that the “Diatom / Dinoflagellate index” indicator can be used to assess the environmental status of the Gulf of Riga.

29,Intermitēta uztura režīma un fizisku vingrinājumu ietekme uz ķermeņa audu kompozīciju sievietēm,"Inermittent fasting, which has become popular in the last decade, is used as one of the methods to regulate body weight. Measures to regulate body weight and fat mass are becoming more and more important both in the world and in Latvia, as the number of people suffering from excessive fat mass accumulation and related cardio-metabolic and skeletal diseases is increasing. The aim of the study was to evaluate which of the methods - correction of the diet, purposeful, regular physical exercises or a combination of the two previous mentioned methods causes more pronounced favorable changes in the composition of body tissues. The study involved 25 women aged 35-50. They formed three study groups, with different study protocols for a 6-week hands-on study: Group 1 - followed the intermittent fasting pattern ""8:16 hours"", Group 2 - followed the intermittent fasting model ""8:16 hours"" and during the study side by side performed the moderate regular, purposeful physical exercises; Group 3 - performed moderate, regular physical exercises, but did not follow the intermittent fasting. The division of the subjects into groups was created by purposefully adapting to the possibilities of the study participants, so that during the study it would be possible to more easily adapt the daily regime to the needs of the study. The waist, hips and thighs circumferences were determined for all subjects, as well as skin folds measurements for triceps, thigh and suprailiac were performed with a caliper Body weight and body composition parameters were determined with bioelectrical impedance analyzer.  The changes of anthropometric and body composition parameters during the 6-week study in all groups of study participants were compared. The results of the study show that the intermittent fasting, as well as the intermittent fasting together with physical activities, show favorable (although not statistically reliable) relative fat mass, as well as changes in visceral fat level and visceral fat area, compared to the physical exercise regimen without intermittent fasting, however, no significant changes in skeletal muscle mass were observed in any of the study groups. As a result of the study, it can be concluded that an intermittent fasting, as well as purposeful physical exercise, is a way to maintain a relatively constant composition of body tissues, without limiting oneself to the variety and quantity of food if food is consumed during a certain time of day. Keywords: intermittent fasting, physical exercises, body composition, weight loss, visceral fat.",0
30,Koksnes staru veidošanās parastajā priedē Pinus sylvestris Tomē lāna briestaudzē,"Scots pine is the most widespread and one of the most economically important conifer species. Mostly for the increacement of its biomass Scots pine uses current carbon assimilates while previous reserves in a form of wood rays can be used as well. During variable, especially extreme, climate conditions proportion of wood rays, therefore the amount of available reserves, can vary which can affect increacement of wood biomass in the future. By measuring the volume of wood rays the response of stress to meteorological factors can be quantified and the importance of social status of trees in stand can be determined. The study was performed in an economical Scots pine Myrtillosa stand located at Tome. During the study cores were gathered from trees of I and III Kraft classes. Anatomical cuts were made in each annual ring, both early and late wood. The samples then were stained and photographed using high resolution equipment. Quantitative analysis of obtained images was performed using Win Cell. Mixed type models were implemented for comparison of mean values of wood rays parameters. Time series and correlation analysis were used to identify correlation between meteorological factors and parameters of wood rays. Principal component analysis was performed to indicate trends of parameters of wood rays. Statistically significant difference of parameters of wood rays was higher between early and late wood than between Kraft classes, pointing at high individuality of trees. While the current meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation and drought) affect parameters of current wood rays, factors of previous growing season show the biggest effect. The research was conducted at University of Latvia, Faculty of Biology in the department of Botany and Ecology and in Latvian State Forest Research Institute “Silava” from June 2018 till May 2020.",0

SUMMARY  The aim of Jekaterina Netača's master's thesis was to find out the knowledge of young swimmers aged 14-21 about nutritional supplements and their experience with their usage. Global research reflects the widespread use of dietary supplements by athletes, but their choice is not always reasonable and safe. The need to study this issue in depth is justified by the lack of research on the use of supplements amongst the population of Latvian athletes. There is also no clear idea about their knowledge and sources of information used in connection with nutritional supplements. The main tasks of the study were to translate and validate a standardized self-assessment questionnaire “Survey on supplements in swimming sports” and to adapt it to the Latvian population, as well as to find out the habits, frequency, reasons and knowledge of the safe use of supplements for young swimmers. The results of the study showed that among swimmers there is a large - 71,5% (n = 113; 95%TI = 0,64-0,78) number of supplement users (p˂0,05). Responses regarding the reasons and why athletes use supplements revealed inconsistencies and suggest widespread misinformation among athletes. The study also showed that the majority of respondents rate their knowledge of supplements as superficial, and only 16,2% (n = 25; 95%TI = 0,11-0,23) consider it good. The study also leads to the conclusion that there is a lack of sufficient and appropriate understanding of the dangers of using nutritional supplements, which increases the risk of using non-anti-doping products.

Therefore these steps are intensively studied and many physical, chemical and biological routes developed. Yet there is a need to adjust the optimal treatment for each type of biomass. In this work I evaluate the effect of explosive decompression pretreatment applied on barley straw and hay, as well as optimal hydrolysis temperature evaluation is presented. The key findings are consistent with literature that the optimal pretreatment temperature is 150º C. Meanwhile, it is doubtful that the energy required for this kind of pretreatment is justifiable, based on ethanol yield increase after fermentation. Moreover, in case with enzyme from Trichoderma reesei it is shown that glucose yield increase after hydrolysis is easy achievable with increase of hydrolysis temperature for 10 - 20º C. These findings confirm that for each type of biomass there is a need for optimal pretreatment method and hydrolysis conditions.",0

Antarctic bacterial strains were retrieved from the Antarctic soil samples collected during the First Latvian Antarctic Expedition. Bacterial strains were identified using 16s rRNA gene sequencing results and strains without any known associated bacteriophages were selected for phage isolation. First known Sporosarcina and Psychrobacillus genera infecting bacteriophages were isolated during this study. Isolated bacteriophages were subject to morphological characterization, whole genome sequencing with further annotation using comparative genomics approaches. Functions for many of the studied phage gene products could not be reliably inferred. Phage sequence uniqueness has proven itself a hurdle for reliable inference of their evolutionary origins. Annotated bacteriophage complete genome sequences were deposited to GenBank open-access biological sequence database with the following titles “Sporosarcina phage Lietuvens”, “Psychrobacillus phage Spoks” and “Psychrobacillus phage Perkons”, under corresponding accession numbers MT104122.1, MT410774.1 un MT325768.1.",0

One of the most frequently used methods of obtaining information on the impact of climatic factors on the species is through the variability of tree ring widths and differences in the anatomical structure of the tree rings. Recently, such dendrecological studies use dwarf shrub species, as they also grow in areas where trees are not. In researches also dwarf birch is often  used, which is a rare and protected species in Latvia. The aim of the study was to determine the climatic factors connection with extreme or pointer years of dwarf birch growing in the raised bog and the bog woodland in Teiču nature reserve. Dwarf birch individuals were collected in the raised swamp and the bog woodland of the territory of the Teiču nature reserve. Five individuals were collected in each area, from which thin cross-sections were subsequently obtained. From the cuts tree rings were measured, after graphically crossdated. Pointer years were calculated using a modified method of relative growth change. The relationship between the significant years and the climatic factors was clarified by correlation analyses. The climatic which used in the research was average, minimum, maximum air temperature, average precipitation and  snow cover, over different periods of time. The work results show that the most significant correlations are with air temperature. The amount of precipitation has mostly negative effect on the radial growth of the dwarf birch. The study found that there was no significant difference between the tree rings variation and the pointer years variation between the two habitats, but the climatic factors affecting the growth of the dwarf birch in the different habitats generally differed.",0

In this research participated 13 clinically healthy volunteers with no bad habbits. Chosen area for assessment was dorsal surface of the hand. One area was control and other EMLA cream anesthetized. Both areas were heated at the same time with one heating element, which was placed on the border of both areas. Video file was 20 minutes long – first video minute was recorded during 32 °C temperature, but remaining 19 minutes were recorded in 42°C temperature. Video photophletysmographic signal of EMLA anesthetized and control area was analyzed in custom-made MATLAB programm, pulsatile and non-pulsatile components of signal were seperated and perfusion index was obtained. In result each person’s data were shown in two graphs, each containing basal perfusion, peak, nadir and plateau phase. Results show that there is statistical disparity between control and anesthetized area’s peak and nadir phase, but there there is minimal disparity in basal perfusion and plateau phase. Statistical disparity also was obtained in axon reflex (peak phase) duration in both areas – in control area the axon reflex lastet longer than in EMLA area. However, standard deviations were obtained within group’s control area’s peak phase and EMLA area’s plateau phase. Therefore further method and protocol standardization is needed. Remote photophletysmography could be an alternative method to laser Doppler imaging.",0
60,Plēsēju smaržas un mehāniskā kairinājuma izraisītā stresa kāpura stadijā ietekme uz Drosophila melanogaster pieaugušo īpatņu ķermeņa oglekļa un slāpekļa koncentrāciju,"The general stress paradigm predicts that predator-induced stress increases the metabolism of prey individuals and causes the breakdown of their energetic reserves. This leads to the increased excretion of nitrogen-containing compounds. This paper deals with the impact of predator scent and mechanical stress during the larval stage onto the imago phenotype of fruit flies. The results show that the predator odor-induced stress significantly decreased the dry body mass, increased body nitrogen concentration, and reduced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the adult flies. Similar phenotypic changes had previously been demonstrated in fruit flies reared with live spiders. This suggests that a sense of smell may have a more important role in the larvae to detect predators compared to the other senses. The results contradict the predictions of the general stress paradigm and might be essential to improve the theory. It also allows us to improve understanding of how predators affect element circulation in ecosystems.",0

The goal of current research was to define reaction to inbreeding in two subspecies of M. hartingi vole under laboratory conditions. Harting’s vole is a convenient model object to study the link between inbreeding and reproductive strategy. In M. h. hartingi, the tendency to reproduce successfully in communal groups might have caused the increase in inbreeding rates and moreover the ability to overcome negative effects of it. Animals exhibit high reproduction rates, stable litter size and low offspring mortality, despite being kept in the laboratory for many generations. It was proven, that attitude to inbreeding in voles was uneven: European subspecies M.h. hartingi does not avoid inbreeding at all; M. h. lydius exhibits stronger negative effects when placed to copulate with close relatives, which results in high offspring mortality rates and even in mate rejection. A rare pathological condition is observed in Harting’s vole - unrestrained incisor growth, which could be the consequence of homozygosity increasing in the laboratory population. Results of current research have shown that both subspecies are able to distinguish between smells of relatives and unfamiliar individuals; both males and females tend to choose unfamiliar partners over relatives.",0

Measuring fluctuating asymmetry is a comparatively new method, that is considered to be effective in determining environmental stress. The aim of this study is to measure fluctuating asymmetry of red firebugs collected from territories with various intensities of environmental radiation and with observing the changes in morphological traits, use it as an indicator of the presence of environmental stress. Firebugs were collected in five cities and one control territory. Measurements of fluctuating asymmetry were done on three segments of the antennae. The occurrence of wing ornament deformations was also assessed. A significant positive correlation between environmental radiation and fluctuating asymmetry of antennae was observed. Differences between fluctuating asymmetry in sexes of red firebugs were observed, potentially because of different abilities of radioresistance. Percentage of wing ornament deformations increased until a specific radiation intensity and then decreased, possibly because of increased natural selection. It was concluded, that increase of environmental radiation intensity increases fluctuating asymmetry in red firebugs.",0

Previous studies have shown that submergence of celery-leaved buttercup plants promotes synthesis of endogenous ethylene, which induces leaf petiole elongation. But the effect of ethylene on the regulation of NaCl responses has not yet been studied. The aim of this work was to design a model system for the studies of ethylene-dependent responses in plants under controlled conditions using the celery-leaved buttercup and to test its use. The use of silica gel achieved an effective reduction of air humidity, at which the petioles of the celery-leaved buttercup do not elongate.

Active air ventilation is used to reduce indoor air pollution, but there are other methods of indoor air purification. One of such techniques is the Green Wall system. The study aimed to examine the effect of ceramic granules, microbial consortia and plant species on the activity of immobilized microorganisms. The study compared these effects on the number of colony-forming units, FDA hydrolysis and PAO activity, and IAA synthesis activity. The type of ceramic granules selected affected the immobilization ability of microorganisms in the biofiltration column system. The immobilized nitrifying bacteria consortium on ceramic granules increased PAO activity. The introduction of a bacterial consortium into the hydroponics system alters the enzymatic activity of microorganisms inhabiting the surface of the granule. The distinct effect of the plant species on the activity of the granule biofilm was also found.

Author of the paper: Lāsma Plociņa, 2nd year student of the study program “Nutrition Science”. Objectives: To evaluate dietary habits in schizophrenic patients and the factors to which they are associated. Hypothesis: 1. Patients with a longer diagnosis have poorer eating habits than patients with a shorter diagnosis. 2. Obesity is observed in patients with poor eating habit. Study design: Quantitative, Cross-sectional study. Participants: 100 patients with schizophrenia in the ""Riga Psychiatry and Narcology Center"" (schizophrenic spectrum disorders after ICD-10, paranoid schizophrenia F20.0). Research Instrument – Questionnaire consisting of 4 parts comprising 24 questions (questionnaire was prepared and modified based on already validated questionnaire). Analysis of results: : Out of one hundred respondents, 92 patients have unhealthy eating habits and only eight have partially healthy eating habits. Using the Spearman correlation test, it was found that eating habits deteriorate with increasing duration of diagnosis. The relationship is very weak but statistically significant (rs = - 0.161, p = 0.05). Using the Spearman correlation test, it was found that eating habits are bad as the body mass index increases. (rs = - 0.44, p = 0.661). Conclusions: Of the surveyed patients, 45 are overweight and 55 have a body mass index within the normal range (18.5 kg / m² - 24.9 kg / m²). There is a weak and partly close correlation between eating habits and the number of meals, the duration of meals, the consumption of vegetables and fruits, fish, fat and water. Drug therapy plays an important role in the expectation of schizophrenia, where regular and correct use is required, in parallel with the type, amount and body mass index of food ingested.

Another significantly associated SNP (rs10837911) is located 1.25Mb from LRRC4C, which interacts with LRRC4 and possible involvement of both of these genes in the tumorigenesis of PA has been studies before. Rest of the 11 SNP`s and their locus association with increased risk and phenotype of PA, is possibly connected with nearby located gene involvement in such cellular processes as cell cycle, tumor suppression, transcription regulation, signal transduction and changes in lnciRNA expression levels. These results provide an insight in to genetic causes of PA in European population and opens an opportunity for further functional studies of PA molecular causes. Research was carried out at the Latvian Biomedicine research and study center as a part of the Human genetics and molecular medicine group from september 2018. till may 2019.",0

The research was done at the Institute of Horticulture between June 2018 and August 2018. The aim of the research was to investigate the anatomical and morphological changes in pear leaves of genotypes with different susceptibility to Gymnosporagium sabinae during the pathogen’s infection cycle. Assessment of the development of European pear rust was done to 35 genotypes, and for 26 of those genotypes assessment of morphological and anatomical traits was made, including measuring leaf water content, leaf area, and leaf mass per area, epiderm thickness, mesophyll thickness, vascular tissue thickness and stomatal density. During the period of research, the intensity of European pear rust was low, which was explained by the dry and hot spring – low precipitation was detrimental to the spread of fungus spores and their ability to infect pears. It was concluded that all genotypes had a decrease in leaf water content and leaf area, however leaf mass per area increased during the research period. There were no considerable differences between susceptible and resistant genotypes. Similarly, there were no considerable differences in the anatomic structures of susceptible and resistant genotypes – the epiderm, mesophyll, vascular tissues and stomatal density was similar for both types of genotypes.",0

However, it is not included in the marine monitoring program and is therefore surveyed periodically in the form of projects and individual, unrelated studies. As a result, information on the seasonal dynamics of the microzooplankton population as well as species composition is missing. Environmental research on environmental factors has been conducted in open Baltic Sea areas and in the Gulf of Riga in the 1980s and 1990s, however, the composition of the species in the Baltic Sea is considered and discussed in the Baltic Sea Zooplankton Atlas. The aim of this work is to find out the changes in microzooplankton biomass in the Gulf of Riga during the spring, summer and autumn season depending on the location and environmental factors. Microzooplankton is analyzed at two offshore stations in the Gulf of Riga under direct freshwater runoff and at one open-air station. It has been observed in the thesis that water temperature and chlorophyll a in water have a significant effect on the total biomass of microzooplankton, while the concentration of water salinity affects the taxonomic composition of microzooplankton. In terms of locality, coastal zones and eustars have a higher microzooplankton biomass than open waters, because changing environmental conditions make it possible to survive both freshwater microzooplankton and brackish microzooplankton.",0

The purpose of this study is to find out: the main regularities that determine the arrangement of birds and number of bird species in agricultural lands in a mosaic landscape. Two to three records on 21 routes were conducted in the study area. The relationship between species and number of habitats was analyzed and models were developed to find out the factors influencing the population density of Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis, whinchat Saxicola rubetra, northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus and common starling Sturnus vulgaris. It was concluded that the number of bird species is affected by the amount of arable land and forest land, reaching the highest number of species where no one of these ecosystems dominates, but both are in equilibrium. However, the number of farmland bird species depends on the amount of agricultural land, which is positively influenced by arable land, all grasslands and land roads. The population density of Eurasian skylark is positively influenced by arable land and sown grassland, but negatively by forest land. The density of whinchat population is positively influenced by fallow fields and perennial grasslands, but negatively by forest lands.

Therefore, it is important to study the relation between vegetation, age of the stand and the factors influencing the density with relatively ecologically tolerant cowberry.  In August and September of 2018, 24 stands in eight sites were set up to find out how the occurrence, cover and age of cowberries varies in different aged stands in the plains of Upmale and Ropaži.  The practical part of the study was developed in a forest type such as Cladinoso-callunosa. In order to characterize the occurrence and coverage of cowberries, in forest stands transect was constructed. In it, vegetation characteristics were taken, samples of three lingonberry ramets were collected, canopy pictures were taken. A plot of 510 m2 around the transects was installed to characterize the density of the forest stand. With sledge-type microtome stem and root samples were cut, processed in the laboratory. Annual tree rings were counted. With WinScanopy program canopy images were processed to get a percentage of canopy opening. In order to explain the occurrence of vegetation in different aged stands, DCA analysis was performed, but in order to assess how the age of the stand, stand density and crown opening affect the cowberry and how it changes in stands, analysis was performed in the program R.  The study concluded that the parameters of the cowberry differ significantly between the plains. Among the age groups of the stand, statistically significant difference in cover is only in the Upmales plain. Coverage is significantly related to the age of the stand, the canopy opening and thickness of the stands (old and medium-old stands), and age with the canopy opening and the age of stand.

In 2017, it was first discovered at Latvia, and research has been started to look for the solutions to understand its distribution. Is is considered that main cause of disease could be bacteria, but oaks with AOD are affected by set of biotic and abiotic factors One of the potential disease agents could be pathogenic fungi, which can potentially weaken diseased oak. It is important to understand if there is any pathogenic fungal species in diseased trees that could possibly lead to oak decline. Comparison between fungal species occurrence in diseased and heathy oak trees could possibly provide useful information for deeper understanding about this disease.  Research took place in four circular sampling plots at Kurzeme. Wood samples had been taken from diseased oak root collar and wounds and also from healthy tree root collar for comparison. Total of 27 fungal species where isolated from all wood samples.  Significant difference between fungal species occurrence in diseased and healthy oaks was not observed. Pathogenic fungal species were found in two of the healthy oaks, which leads to the consideration that healthy oaks nearby diseased oaks might also be already diseased, but visible AOD symptoms haven’t appeared yet.   33 samples from diseased trees and 32 samples from healthy trees were taken. Total of 9 fungal species where isolated from wood samples which had been taken from wounds of diseased oaks, and only 3 of them turned out to be weak plant pathogens, which could possibly cause faster oak decline.  Bacteria occurrence in oaks are statistically significant (p=0,019), which means, that there is a need for further investigation about bacteria role in AOD.",0

Fires are a boreal and hemiboreal forest natural disturbance agent, which change ecosystem landscape and biological diversity. Intensive forest management has limited fire outbreaks to a minimum, but the fire-affected forest will increase in northern Europe due to global changes. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how management (natural regeneration vs salvage logging with or without planting) affects ecosystems, including understory vegetation diversity. Data were collected in Slīteres National park and in neighbouring managed forest in 2017 and 2018 to determine effect of forest management on understory vegetation. Sample plots (10 large plots each containing 4 small plots) were established within a design including four forest types and three management types. Understory vegetation composition and diversity were described in the sample plots. Ellenberg weighted values and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index were calculated and tree stand canopy openness was estimated.  Results show that management effect has a significant effect on understory vegetation cover, however, Calluna vulgaris was the dominant species in all forest and management types, which affected regeneration in Slīteres National park.",0

The obtained data show that the sex as a factor does not affect the linear parameters and brain's shape of the studied taxa, which indicates a weak effect of the sex on morphological adaptation and variability of the brain structure in the selection process. Significant differences in the absolute and relative mass of the brain (cephalization indeces) are found: the smallest one for M. guentheri is noted, greater for M. hartingi. The indeces of the M. hartingi and M. h. lydius populations are noticeably diverged. The linear measurements of the investigated taxa also differ significantly. The subspecies M. hartingi differ in the brain height as well as M. guentheri and M. hartingi species differs in height, width and length of the brain. The lateral length of the hemisphere in M. h. lydius is longest, followed by M. h. hartingi and in the M. guentheri the length is smallest. The obtained data indicate that the divergence of M. guentheri is deeper (16 parameters), which is obviously related to the older isolation of this species by the mountain range ""Anatolian diagonal"". The isolation of the M. hartingi population occurred later by the Bosporus Strait, so the difference in brain structure is slightly less (11 parameters). Geometric deformities of the brain in all taxa are found. Analysis of canonical variations showed that all three taxa differ significantly, both laterally and dorsally. Comparing the taxa DFA lateral view are found differences in brain form, M. h. harting cerebellum hemisphere and brains hemisphere are expanded from above, while M. h. lydius have a small olfactory bulbs. By dorsal view DFA M. h. harting have a slightly longer olfactory bulbs than M. h. lydius. M. guentheri cerebellum hemisphere and worm are wider than the M. hartingi.",0

Root rot mostly infects spruce through tree stumps, left after forest tinning, further spreading through root contacts. As the amount of former agricultural lands being afforested is growing, it is important to determine how Heterobasidion spp. will spread in spruce stands on former agricultural lands which were afforested. During the study 15 spruce stands were surveyed in eight of which Heterobasidion root rot was found. Two of these stands (Tirelu and Zemgales forestry’s) were chosen for more detailed research on spread of butt rot. 297 wood samples were gathered from stands in Tireli 27,6 % of which were infected with Heterobasidion and 184 wood samples were taken in Zemgales forestry, of which infected were 28,6 %. Results show that there is a significant difference between data about root rot’s spread on former agricultural lands reported in literature and data recorded in this study.

115,Nātrija un kālija sāļu salīdzinošā ietekme uz dažādu sugu augu augšanu un jonu uzkrāšanos,"Salinity is one of abiotic factors that has an essential effect on growth and development of plants in coasal habitats, saline wetlands, dry regions of the world. Plant species that have natural distribution in habitats with high salinity, are characterized by significantly larger salt tolerance than plant species that are distributed in habitats with low salt concentration, including crop plants. As  NaCl is the most common type of salt, its impact on plants is most studied. There is small number of studies about the other type of salts and their effect comparative to that of NaCl. It is thought that Na+ induces osmotic stress, ion toxicity, ion dissbalance, resulting to suboptimal physiological processes in plants, which reduce growth  and vitality. However, there is insufficient understanding about the effect of anions in Na salts and Na+ comparative effect with other cations, for example K+. The aim of this work was to compare the effect of different Na and K salts on plant growth and accumulation of these ions in tissues using both crop plants and wild plants. Crop plant Secale cereale (salt sensitive species or glycophyte) and wild species Ranunculus sceleratus, Rumex confertus, Rumex hydrolapathum, Rumex longifolius and Rumex maritimus were used as model species in the present study. Seeds of wild plants, except R. confertus, were collected in saline habitats. In controlled conditions, hydroponic experiments (Secale cereale) and vegetation experiments in soil (wild species) were established with application of different type of Na and K salts.  Acoording to the results of growth parameters and ion accumulation, several relationships were observed. Na and K effect differed by plant species and the type of salt used. Only for Secale cereale unequivocal more positive effect of K on plant growth were observed, in other species differences between Na and K varied. Predominantly differences between the effect of  NaCl and KCl were not observed. In  treatments with other types of salt, Na had more negative or more positive effect in comparision with K, or there were no differences between these ions. Overall the results of all species showed that the type of anion had more impact on plant growth than the type of cation. The effects of anion, like cation, also differed between species. In wild species the dry mass was several times higher in  NaNO3 and KNO3 treatments than in control and treatment with other types of salt, in Rumex species also number of leaves increased. In Secale cereale in NaNO3 treatment, similar to other types of salt, dry mass decreased, however it decreased less. Only in Secale cereale high correlation between the concentration of Na ions and decreased growth was observed.",0

Two year data on feeding selection in two young pine stands is summarized and discussed in master’s thesis “A detailed approach to deer (Cervidae) winter feeding selection factor assessment in young pine stands”. Data on fresh and previous browsing signs as well as bark stripping signs was collected shortly after winter season. Browsing and bark stripping spatial patterns differed between years, however trees with signs of previous browsing were more likely to be browsed repeatedly. Browsing was associated with taller trees, whereas bark stripping occurred more often on thicker tree trunks. Bark stripping was also more likely to happen closer to ditches. The effect of forestry practices on browsing and bark stripping had mixed effect, however the results suggest that forest cleaning increased the occurrence of tree damage caused by ungulate feeding.",0

On research voluntarily participated 14 clinically healthy participants. During the measurement, the control area of the skin and with the EMLA cream anesthetized area of the skin on the dorsal surface of hand were heated simultaneously, placing the heating element on the border of both zones. After ten minutes of heating, a minute long video was recorded using a camera equipped with a narrow-band filter. The video iPPG signal was analyzed in a specially customized program. The vasomotor response (flare) area of both zones was measured in the resulting perfusion map.  The results of the study show that there is a statistical disparity between the flare size in the control area and the anesthetized skin area, confirming the role of the neurogenic component in the vasomotor response. When comparing the individual differences between the subjects, flare size in the both areas of the skin showed a large variation, which does not allow to estimate, what should be the normal response to local heating.  Further research are needed to find the best way to use the imaging photoplethymorphography in the evaluation of skin vasomotor responses. Imaging photoplethymorphography could be an alternative to currently widely used laser Doppler flowmetry.",0

Tiltiņa K., supervisor Dr. biol. Asoc. Prof. Ozoliņa-Molla L. Master thesis, 61 pages, 19 figures, 15 tables, 47 literature references, 2 appendices. In Latvian. High intensity interval training (HIIT) recently has become very popular and used widely to reduce fat mass, especially visceral fat. During HIIT high intensity (80 – 95% of maximal heart rate) intervals are mixed with active recovery intervals with moderate (40 – 60% of maximal heart rate) intensity.  The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of high intensity interval training to energetic substrate oxidation during exercise and post-exercise recovery period. 12 young (aged 18 till 30) clinically healthy women took part in the study. Main methods used in the study – indirect calorimetry, veloergometry and ultrasonography. Results of the study prove that the main energetic substrate during HIIT are carbohydrates, but immediately after training organism “switches” to lipolysis with increased energy expenditure in comparison to rest and use of carbohydrates decrease. Glucose concentration in the blood did not change significantly during HIIT and post- exercise recovery period ( 0,3 mmol/L), but concentration of triglycerides significantly increased during HIIT and decreased significantly below rest value after HIIT, which shows that HIIT mobilizes available fat. Ultrasonographic measurements indicate that study participants with lower physical activity level have higher preperitoneal fat thickness and resting triglyceride level, which decreases even more after the HIIT in comparison to more physically active participants. This indicate, that acute effects of HIIT are more expressed in persons with higher visceral adiposity.",0

The aim of the study was to rate the quality of raspberry pollen and pollination depending on pollen infection with raspberry bushy dwarf virus. To assess this, were analyzed the viability and germination of nine raspberry varieties in different germination conditions in 2017 and 2018. Cross-breeding was performed in field conditions, but the quality of pollination of 31 hybridizations was evaluated with the method of fluorescence in the laboratory.  In the study found that although the viability of pollen from cultivars that infected with raspberry dwarf viruses is higher than pollen of non-infected cultivars, there were not statistically significant differences. The germination of pollens is largely influenced by the cultivar and growing conditions, but one of the virus-infected cultivar ‘Ina’ showed a statistically significantly higher mean germination capacity. The initial hypothesis that infection of pollen has a significant role in the pollination process has been confirmed partly, because it was proved that the virus infection of motherplants is more important in the pollination process. Pollination occurs better and pollen grows faster on not infected motherplants than infected. However, if a virus-infected cultivar is pollinated with infected pollen, the pollination rate is further reduced, pollen does not reach the ovule and no fertilization occurs, so it can be concluded that the virus has an effect on the growth of pollen germs, however, the specificity of the cultivars and the possible impact of other factors should also be taken into account.",0

The goal of our study is to find out whether Full biomass removal from the territory (Whole tree harvesting – WTH), has negatively affected the regeneration of the vegetation or soil chemical composition. At the study we looked at the vegetation and soil chemical composition in pine stands of Vacciniosa, Myrtillosa and Myrtillosa mel. and in spruce stands of Myrtillosa mel. In each forest type were selected teritories in stands of (WTH) same age control stands as well as young stands, mature stands and old stands.  It was concluded that WTH had the largest number of species in Myrtillosa mel. stands and the second largest number of species in other forest types. According to the species diversity indices, the WTH area did not differ significantly (p> 0.05) from the control stand and the young stand. The DCA and ANOSIM analyzes concluded that the differences in soil vegetation between the WTH and the control stand were insignificant: both analyzes show the similarity of the areas by the (R) value. Ellenberg's values showed that the growth conditions for the WTH teritory were similar to those of the same age control and did not differ significantly. According to the collected soil data, pH, total carbon and total nitrogen in WTH and control stands are not significantly different. Thus, in general, WTH's long-term management has not negatively affected ground vegetation and soil chemical composition.",0

Significant results of clinical trials in diagnostics and treatment of prostate cancer have been achieved with radiolabelled PSMA ligands for 68Ga-PSMA - diagnostics and 177Lu-PSMA - therapy. Neuroendocrine tumours are a heterogeneous group of aggressive tumours with different and often non-specific symptoms that makes it difficult to pinpoint the diagnosis of primary tumour and the stage of disease. Currently, these radionuclides conjugated to SSTR2 ligands (somatostatin analogues) are used in the diagnosis and treatment of these tumours.  The aim of this work was to create an in vitro model system based on different cell lines that could be used to characterize molecularly targeted radionuclides and to assess their functional effects. Six different cell lines were cultivated within this work, in which the expression of the target receptors PSMA and SSTR2 were testes by immunocytochemical method and the results obtained were further validated by molecularly targeted radionuclide binding reactions. Results were analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.  As a result of the work, the expression of SSTR2 and PSMA, which was validated, was determined in the selected cell lines and evaluated for the radionuclide binding reaction. Based on these results, panels of prostate cancer and neuroendocrine cell lines were created, including cancer cells with pronounced and weakly expressed target receptors as well as normal cell control. The prostate cancer cell panel included PC cell lines LNCaP (PSMA ++), PC3 (PSMA +/-) and dermal fibroblasts Hs68; neuroendocrine tumour panel - NET cell lines AR42J (SSTR2 ++), NCI-H69 (SSTR2 +), CorL23 (SSTR2-) and Hs68.

To achieve this aim, the ability of microorganisms to inhibit the growth of other microorganisms was used (antagonism). It has been previously shown that lactic acid bacteria have antagonistic properties. In this work lactic acid bacteria were selected as research object and were isolated from local fresh and fermented cucumbers.  133 isolates were identified and were classified to seven lactic acid bacteria species: Leuconostoc citreum Leuconostoc mesentoides, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum. Antagonism of lactic acid bacteria was investigated against isolated from fresh cucumbers Serratia marcescens, Erwinia persicina and Rhizobium radiobacter, using agar well-diffusion method. To treat fresh vegetables, it was planned to use cell-free supernatants obtained after growth of lactic acid bacteria in MRS broth. It was shown that the antagonism of cell cultures and cell-free supernatants was similar. The time of lactic acid bacteria growth influenced antagonism of the cell-free supernatants. The main mechanism of antagonism is related to lactic acid and bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria during the growth. Fresh cucumbers were treated with four selected cell-free supernatants. In vivo results indicate that supernatants of lactic acid bacteria have potential to be used for the treatment and protection of fresh vegetables from phytopathogens used in this study.",0

After purification, the recombinant protein was used to evaluate sortase inhibitors by screening that is based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method. Overall 966 potential inhibitory compounds were tested, and the best three compounds were selected that demonstrated the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) from 38,18 uM to 97,85 uM. After antimicrobial activity and cell cytotoxicity assays two compounds were selected that demonstrated low MIC activity and cell cytotoxicity, respectively 60 uM and 87 uM. After chemical modifications these compounds can be used as possible drug prototypes to combat the virulence of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.",0
140,"Trichoderma asperellum, Bacillus subtilis un to konsorcija ietekme uz augsnes mikroorganismiem","The goal of the study was to determine if T.asperellum, B.subtilis and their consortia affect the microorganisms of the soil. During the study, experimental soil samples were prepared and treated with B.subtilis, T.asperellum, B.cinerea and their consortia. The amount of bacteria and fungi in soil samples that underwent different treatments was determined by microbiological methods. Using the Biolog EcoPlates method, the ability of the metabolic activity of microorganisms in soil was determined. The concentration of Trichoderma genus, Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria DNA in soil samples was determined by molecular methods. A correlation analysis was performed between microbiological and molecular data and only between molecular results data. Soil treatment with certain microorganisms and their consortia increased or decreased the amount of certain taxon-forming units and amplified DNA fragments in the soil. Various microorganisms and their consortia increase the utilisation of carbohydrates and complex carbon compounds but reduce the use of organic phosphorus compounds in the soil. Increasing CFU/g will also increase the concentration of amplified DNA fragments in certain samples after a certain number of days.",0

Research was made in the Hydrobiology department of the University of Latvia, as a part of the EJZF project “Plan for the evaluation and managment of macroalgae rinse on the coast of Latvia” developed by the association “Baltijas krasti”. The aim of the paper is to identify the storage sites, distribution, taxonomic composition and seasonal dynamics of the rinsed macrophytes in the Vidzeme’s seashore, Kurzeme’s seashore and the open part of the Baltic Sea. In the Master's paper available literature on macroalgae growing in the Baltic Sea, morphological, physiological structure of algae, growth and reproduction conditions, described abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors affecting the Baltic Sea and macroalgae stands, identified sites of the development of rinsed macroalgae in the open part of Baltic Sea and the coast of the Gulf of Riga, viewed seasonal dynamics of macroalgae, defined taxonomic composition and developed recommendations for practical use of macrophytic algae. The Baltic Sea, with it’s specific hydro-meteorological conditions, provides the environment for the formation of bands of rinsed macroalgae. The formation of algal bands on the Latvian coast of the Baltic Sea is very uneven, depending on the season,coastal morphology and, above all, the frequency of storms. Individual areas are characterised by a complete shortage of rinsed algae. Maximum volume of rinsed macroalgae evaluated during autumn expedition in Liepaja, reaching 228.3 m3/100 m. In the open part of the Baltic Sea dominates red algae Furcellaria lumbricalis, in the Kurzeme’s seashore of the Gulf of Riga dominates brown algae Fucus vesiculosus, while in the Vidzeme’s coast of the Gulf of Riga, depending on the season, observed a relative balance between the brown algae Fucus vesiculosus and the generas of green algae - Cladophora spp. and Enteromorpha spp.. As sites for potential accumulation of rinsed macroalgae on the coast of the open part of the Baltic Sea – Liepaja and Pavilosta, Kurzeme’s seashore of the Gulf of Riga – Jaunkemeri, Melluzi and Lapmezciems, Vidzeme’s coast of the Gulf of Riga – Salacgriva and Saulkrasti.  Changing circumstances have resulted in changes in the methods and volumes of algae collection. However, Latvia does not have unified system where to store and how to use them. The accumulation of algae create major problems for the management of tourism and recreational areas. The mechanically collected algae, which are loaded into the coastal dunes or bush area, are folded back into the sea during storms, resulting in secondary pollution. These piles of macroalgae disrupt recreation and tourism, change habitats, degrade landscape and species deposits. Coastal nature must be preserved by zoning, maintaining balance with the collection, removal and use of macroalgae.",0

Insects were collected with the window trap method in 5 different landscapes. A total of 1391 specimen were collected consisting of 14 different families in the order Hymenoptera, and after evaluating morphological differences (except for the family Ichneumonidae),  88 morphospecies were distinguished. After evaluating different variable factors and insect diversity, it was concluded that the number of Hymenoptera in burnt forests was significantly higher than in non-burnt forests. Higher burn area, age of burns, forest age and thickness of tree bark did not have a significant impact on the number of Hymenoptera. The diameter of the tree affected numbers of Hymenoptera positively. Trees damaged more by burns had more morphospecies, but it had no correlation with the total number of Hymenoptera and Hymenoptera families. The number of Hymenoptera doesn’t change with the decay rate of the tree, but there is a visible tendency for dead and dry woods to have a slightly higher amount and diversity of Hymenoptera.",0

In Latvia, there are three epidemically significant tick species: Ixodes ricinus, Ixodus persulcatus and Dermacentor recticulatus. This study focused on employing molecular methods to identify tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia spp. in tick samples collected from biotopes and comparing prevalence regarding the aforementioned tick species.  In years 2017-2018, a total of 3494 ticks were collected and screened from biotopes from the five Latvian regions. The distribution of ticks species were characterized and the prevalence of pathogens were studied using a two-step polymerase chain reaction followed by employing positive amplicone sequencing in order to differentiate between the identified pathogen species. The amount of pathogens in the ticks were compared on the basis of the tick species, stage and sex. In total, 21.2% of ticks were pathogen-positive, while the co-infection was found in 1.4% of samples. The prevalence of pathogens was the highest in I. persulcatus (34.5%), and the lowest – in D. reticulatus. Borrelia spp. was the most prevalent infection, and all three Lyme disease species, namely B. afzelii, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi, were found. D. reticulatus distribution area has increased in Latvia, while the I. ricinus appeared to be the main vector for B. canis canis. The obtained results have showed a substantial risk for the tick-borne infection both for humans and animals, and the distribution of pathogens and vectors appeared to be a dynamic process in Latvian regions.",0

In this method two taxonomically close species with different habitats are compared. The goal of this work is to inspect the differences in mating strategies of two Microtus hartingi subspecies, and its connection to subspecies formation in a fragmented area.   To measure the intensity of male care towards its offspring and female reproduction success in monogamous groups and polygynous groups with females who were relatives or unrelated with each other two M. hartingi subspecies were used: M. h. hartingi and M. h. lydius. Experiments were carried out in a laboratory setting. To measure the reproduction success 70 groups with male and female, 70 groups with male and two related females, and 22 groups with male and two unrelated females were made. To measure the male care of the litter 64 males were used: 32 M. h. hartingi and 32 M. h. lydius.  Results show that the most successful mating strategy for M. h. lydius is monogamy; there is no tendency to form communal groups. Males show high intensity of parental care, which is a characteristic of monogamous species. Whereas M. h. hartingi reproduce successfully in monogamous and polygynous groups; there is a tendency to form communal groups. The intensity of male parental care is lower than in M. h. lydius. The tendency to form communal groups for M. h. hartingi is related to subspecies formation and existence in a fragmented area.",0

The causes of autism are multifactorial, and its aetiology is complex, with both environment and genetic factors playing a significant influence. According to the CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) 2014 data, ASD prevalence is 1 in 59 children in the United States. The estimated prevalence of ASD in children in Latvia, similarly to Europe, is 1 in 100. Currently, according to the medicinal literature there is no one therapy for the treatment of ASD symptoms. However, there are studies showing that with dietary changes, usually in combination with nutritional supplements, some ASD symptoms can be significantly decreased. The most commonly used diet for ASD is gluten-free, casein-free diet (GF/CF). The objective of the study was to investigate whether a low carbohydrate diet (SCD, Specific carbohydrate diet /GAPS, Gut and Psychology Syndrome diet), complemented with vitamins/supplements (vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, vitamin C, ascorbyl palmitate), could improve gastrointestinal  health in children with ASD, as well as, reduce some typical ASD symptoms. SCD/GAPS diet suggests avoiding sugar, grains, starchy vegetables, non-fermented milk products and processed food. This was a prospective case-control three-month intervention study that involved 10 children with ASD, who followed SDC/GAPS diet and used the abovementioned vitamins/supplements, as well as 7 children with ASD, who did not change their diet and, and this smaller group was used as a control group. Participants were 2 to 18 years old. The symptoms of children were evaluated 3 times during the study (in the beginning, middle, end of the study) using seven internationally validated questionnaires. The validation of these questionnaires in Latvian was performed during this study.  The study confirmed that SDS/GAPS diet, complemented with vitamins/minerals, can improve behaviour, reduce hyperactivity and sensory sensitivity, and improve speech perception/understanding and socialisation of children with ASD. In order to confirm these results, a larger study over a longer period of time would be necessary. SCD/GAPS diet and the use of recommended vitamins/supplements could be a safe and effective approach to help reduce some symptoms of children with ASD.",0
151,Uztura paradumi un dzīvesveids grūtniecēm ar gestācijas diabētu,"The prevalence of gestational diabetes in the world is growing rapidly, affecting about 14% of all pregnant women. There are many risk factors for the development of gestational diabetes, and pregnancy itself contributes to the development of the disease, during which the insulin resistance increases ad cells are unable to fully use the glucose in blood for energy production. The change of lifestyle (nutritional habits, physical activity) plays an important role in reducing gestational diabetes and related complications. The aim of the research - to study the nutritional and physical activity habits of pregnant women with gestational diabetes. The design of the research - cross-sectional research involving 55 pregnant women and women one week after childbirth, where 21 of them had gestational diabetes (study group) and 34 were healthy pregnant women (control group). The selection of participants took place according to the principle of convenience, by carrying out a survey of pregnant women in the premises of Riga Maternity Hospital and in the private practice room of endocrinologist Spodrīte Keisa. The questionnaire “Nutrition habits of pregnant women in Latvia and its influencing factors” was used to clarify the habits of nutrition and physical activity. Results. In the group with gestational diabetes, the majority of pregnant women 71.4% (n = 15) indicate that they were overweight before pregnancy. Observing the readings from medical records for pregnant women with gestational diabetes during the first visit, the average BMI was increased by 28.35 (± 5.78) kg/m2. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes include more vegetables in their daily nutrition - an average of nine servings per week, however, in the pregnant control group - an average of six servings per week. 38.1% (n = 8) of pregnant women with gestational diabetes take the recommended exercise for 30 minutes, two to three times a week, while the same exercise is taken of 41.2% (n = 14) of pregnant women in the control group. Conclusions. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes most often do not choose to include porridge and breakfast cereals in their daily meals, and choose meat as the main source of protein. The most common choice for snacks is fruit and the rarest one - vegetables. The most frequent leisure activities are walking, cycling or other light physical activities.",0

Background: Rapid increase of obesity in children and adolescents is alerting health problem. Regular measurements of weight and height, including body mass index (BMI) plotting on growth charts are important tools in monitoring children health and nutritional status. Early detection and treatment is likely to reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic diseases. The aim of the study is to evaluate dietary habits, physical fitness and blood plasma biochemical parameters in junior school age children according to the parameters characterizing the physical development of children.  Materials and methods. 96 children (age 9-10 years) from 13 schools in Latvia were enrolled in the study.  Anthropometric data and blood pressure were measured with standard procedures. Fitness level was determined by 3-minute step test. In order to find out children nutritional habits food frequency questionnaire was used. Children were divided into two groups: one group with overweight/obesity (N=32) and the second group with normal BMI/ underweight (N=64) based on World Health Organization BMI percentile scale. Nutritional habits and fitness level were compared between both groups. Triglyceride, high density lipoprotein and glucose levels were determined by E. Gulbis clinical laboratory. Estimated parameters using International Diabetes Federation criteria of metabolic syndrome in children were compared in both groups.  Results. There was a significant difference between the normal/underweight and overweight/obesity group in BMI, waist circumference, fitness level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose and triglyceride concentration. Three participants in overweight/obesity group have two International Diabetes Federation criteria of metabolic syndrome. Only 57.3% of participants eat breakfast every day, 24% eat fruits and 35.4% vegetables every day. In normal/underweight group participants eat more vegetables and drink more sweetened drinks. Conclusions: The primary results of the study provide a comprehensive analysis of children's dietary habits, blood plasma biochemical parameters, fitness level and physical development. The results suggest that children's dietary habits require significant adjustments to produce beneficial effects on children's physical development and regulation of blood plasma lipids and glucose homeostasis. Key words: dietary habits, physical development, blood plasma parameters, junior school age children.",0
155,"Studentu izpratnes, informētības un intereses izvērtējums par pievienotajiem cukuriem","Sugar is a part of our daily diet. People like it, and it is being consumed in many ways – by adding it to tea or coffee, in sugar sweetened beverages, or many other products where it is added during the manufacturing process and it would be hard to imagine about. Sugar overconsumption is a general health problem of the population globally. The basis of concern about overconsumption of added sugars is excessive caloric load without any nutritional value, which leads to positive energy balance in diet. That may lead to progress of health problems like obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2.diabetes (WHO, 2015). Young people are the group of population who do not care much about their dietary habits. Consumption of fruit, vegetable and wholegrain is less likely than sweets and sugar sweetened beverages (Vilaro et.al., 2018). Also, the data show that level of knowledge and understanding is weak about healthy diet and place of sugar in it. But – as the knowledge is higher, the level of interest is also growing and the consumption of sugar is lower. The data obtained in our questionnaire show that understanding of added sugars is quite weak. Although, students are interested in their sugar consumption to maintain body weight or by health concerns, in most cases, added sugars are not recognized in the food labels. In about 50% of cases, sugar amount on the paper is not understood in real life. Anyway, students are interested in the topic and the idea of showing added sugars on the food label separately is evaluated positively as well as the use of mass media for educational purposes.",0

There is some research that links encephalopathy and B19V, HBoV, hPARV4, although precise mechanisms of disease etiology are unknown. Parvoviruses are small Parvoviridae family members that have singlestranded DNS that is 5-6 kilobases long. These viruses don’t have an envelope, but only a capsid. The aim of this study was to analyse B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 possible role in pathogenesis of unspecified encephalopathy. Blood and plasma DNA from 28 patients with unspecified encephalopathy were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences. 6/28 (21,43%) patients were positive for B19V, 5/25 (20%) – for HBoV, none for hPARV4.

Goal of this thesis was to use these receptors to measure the effects of the HA tagand the GFP on receptor membrane turnover by carrying out enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging accordingly. Due to technical complications the effects of GFP was not determined, but observed effect of the HA tag diminishes the possibilty of it. Statistically signigicant effect of HA tag was measured as it increased the MC2R surface expression, while it did not affect membrane turnover of MC4R. The stimulatory effect of the N-terminal HA tag exceeded the one of elevating the membrane turnover of MC2R associated protein (MRAP) in CHO cells. Tagging N-terminus with the HA peptide creates an artifact, because it abnormaly increases the membrane turnover of the MC2R, in this system it can not be used to characterise this parameter as in normal conditions.Methods for measuring membrane turnover using epitope tags should be validated with different techniques.",0

Various synthetic gene delivery agents that are safer than recombinant viruses have been developed, however, they do not possess the required efficacy. Dendrimers are type of synthetic delivery vehicles that exhibit several advantages over other delivery agents, and these nanoparticles have been investigated over past few years for in vitro and in vivo genetic material delivery. In this study, four different dendrimers – generation four poly(amidoamine) dendrimer PAMAM G4, generation four cationic phosphorous dendrimer CPD G4, generation four cationic phosphorous dendrimer AE2 G4 and generation two cationic carbosilane dendrimer CBD-CS G2, were studied to characterize their ability to interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and form dendrimer-pDNA complexes. Furthermore, in vitro transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity experiments were performed. Also, the ability of two dendrimers – CPD G4 and CBD-CS G2 – to introduce DNA in vivo in murine animal model was examined using bioluminescence imaging. The results of the biophysical characterization studies indicate that all four dendrimers efficiently bind pDNA and form stable complexes. Dendrimer CBD-CS G2 was the most efficient for cell transfection, and no significant cytotoxicity was observed. In vivo bioluminescence studies showed that CBD-CS G2 dendrimer is not an efficient genetic material delivery vehicle. In contrast, mice treated with pDNA complexed to increasing concentration of CPD G4 dendrimer, displayed bioluminescence in concentration dependent manner, and the highest photon flux was obtained in mice treated with 50 µg of CPD G4. These results indicate that phosphorous dendrimer CPD G4 is the most suitable one of the four investigated dendrimers for in vivo gene delivery, however, increase of transfection efficacy requires further optimization of DNA-dendrimer formulations.",0

The aim of this work was to investigate the use of yeast Kluyveromyces lactis in the biosynthesis of 2-phenylethanol in lactose containing medium. We determined the most suitable K. lactis strain for 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis, investigated the effect of medium composition on 2-PE production, dinamics of 2-PE synthesis during fermentation, K. lactis DSM 70799 2-phenylethanol tolerance, and two-phase extractive fermentation with rapeseed oil was performed.  In this work three industrially used K. lactis strains were used. From these strains K. lactis DSM 70799 produced the highest 2-phenylethanol concentration. The higher 2-PE concentration was obtained in lactose medium, therefore, as a substrate for the production of 2-phenylethanol, can be used lactose containing cheese whey and milk permeate. Phenylethanol is toxic to yeasts and inhibition of cell growth begins by adding 2,04 g/L of 2-PE. To reduce the toxicity and increase the amount of produced 2-PE, two-phase extractive fermentation with the addition of oil can be performed.  Methods mastered during the research: yeast cultivation methods, two-phase fermentation, biomass determination with spectrophotometer and multimode micro plate reader – incubator, determination of 2-PE with HPLC chromatograph and enzymatic determination of sugars.",0

It has a positive impact on species biological diversity and its presence is one of the indicators for enrichment in growing conditions (Bryant 1983). Similar to trees bilberry annual rings provide information about conditions in specific territory, nevertheless about shorter period of time (Schwingruber, Poschold 2005). Slitere national park and its surrounding was chosen as a study area because of the various aged Vacciniosa stands found in this territory. Also because of the forest fire which affected part of its territory. In total 21 plots (10 x 10 m) were made. Six of them were established in Vacciniosa young stands (13 – 21 years old), the rest of them were established in Vacciniosa stands with age ranging from 42 to 257 years. In each of the sampling plots five subplots were made based on specific scheme. In each subplot vegetation cover (%) and specie composition was determined. Diagonally three bilberry ramet samples were collected. Samples were processed in laboratory, measured the diameter, height and determined the age. DCA ordination analysis was used to determine differences in vegetation between sites. Generalized mixed linear model was made, to determine forest age influence on bilberry ramet parameters. This study finds that vegetation between different aged Vacciniosa stands do not differ. Whereas bilberry cover (%) differs and has a positive correlation with the stand age. Likewise forest stand age positively affects bilberry ramet parameters – diameter, height, age. Yet increased forest stand age decrease presence possibility of three to five year old bilberry ramets which have the most intensive formation of new clones. In young stands vegetation groups into two parts, respectively vegetation in burned and unburned stands. Significant differences in bilberry cover between both stand types were not observed. Master's Thesis was established in University of Latvia, Faculty of Biology, at the department of Botany and Ecology and in Latvian State Forest Research Institute “Silava” from May 2016 till May 2018.",0

The target of the study was to reveal the role of artificial nestbox inner lighting level on the nest-site choice of Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca and Great Tit Parus major. In nature reserve “Garkalnes meži,” 152 nestboxes in 4 sample plots were prepared for the experiment by painting inner-hind walls of the nestboxes white, black and left unpainted (treatment). During the nesting season, nestbox occupation and internal lighting data were collected. In total, 32 Ficedula hypoleuca and 8 Parus major occupied nestboxes were observed. After carrying out dispersion and linear regression model analysis, the colour of inner-hind wall and level of internal lighting were determined as influential factors on nestbox occupation and nesting attempts. Results revealed that by the level of inner lighting nestboxes with white inner-hind walls are the brightest ones, black ones are the darkest and the unpainted (treatment) nestboxes are positioned in between. It was found out that the effect of nestbox defects on nestbox occupation is of negative statistical insignificance. Due to inssuficient amount of data it was not possible to determine nest-choice trends for Great Tits, for Pied Flycatchers a prefered choice of nestboxes with higher level of internal lighting was confirmed. Except in unpainted (treatment) group, occupation of nestboxes tends to increase along with increasing level of inner lighting.

Apple scab management is mostly based on intense and regular use of pesticides, resulting with negative environmental impacts and negative impacts of human health. An alternative is to create scab resistant apple trees cultivars. It has already been observed that monogenic resistance to apple scab is not durable and it could be improved by including multiple resistance genes in one plant genotype or making gene pyramiding. The aim of the study was to evaluate and characterize Malus domestica (Malus × domestica) resistance against apple scab (causal agent Venturia inaequalis) heredity and the effectiveness of the selection process in hybrid families with different parental resistance. For this purpose, samples of 862 apple hybrids has been analyzed. Samples are divided into populations, depending on the resistance genes (Rvi6 and Rvi5) occurred in the parent genotype and their combinations (Rvi6 × susceptible variety; Rvi6 × Rvi6 and Rvi5 × Rvi5). Field scoring has been performed in 2016 and 2017. Scorings are made using the international VINQUEST apple scab assessment methodology, but the genes were identified by using specific and SSR markers. In parent genotyping 22 SSR molecular markers has been used.  There are only few studies that includes combined analyze of molecular and apple scab field resistance scoring data, although they can give more realistic pattern of resistance selection process. The study showed that the resistance of the apple scab in field is affected not only by resistance genes in genotype, but also the origin of apple cultivar, tree health status and resistance to other diseases. Apple scab resistance is determined by genetic factors, but the environment also has a modifying effect. The assessment of the heredity for resistance genes included in the breeding, it was found that the resistance genes Rvi6 (Vf) and Rvi5 (Vm) are inherited in accordance with Mendel's laws. The pyramiding of both genes in progeny discovered their separate inheritance. In general, the inheritance of both genes in progeny was not a main determining factor of apple field resistance tree, because the field's resistance to apple scab is influenced by a combination of several factors.",0

193,Organomāla piedeva saplākšņa aizsardzībai pret brūnās un baltās trupes sēnēm,"Organoclay is a material with antimicrobial properties and it has the potential to be used for protection against wood degrading fungi. This study examines the effect of two types of organoclay that contain trimethyloctadecylammonium chloride on Coniophora puteana and Trametes versicolor. Furthermore, the effectiveness to provide protection to birch plywood against wood-decay fungi with an organoclay additive in phenol-formaldehyde resin glue and impregnation film was also evaluated. The red organoclay had better inhibitory properties against wood-decay fungi than the white organoclay when added to a malt extract-agar medium. Based on the data from standards NF B 51-295 (bending strength test) and LVS ENV 12038:2002 (mass loss test), our results show that experimentally laminated plywood is more durable against wood-decay fungi than experimentally laminated plywood with an organoclay additive. It has been found that C. puteana degrades plywood more efficiently than T. versicolor. None of the four tested types of plywood was fully resistant against decay fungi due to their mass loss being greater than 3 %. Comparing samples with two different sizes for each of the standards, it was found that sample size affects the results. In conclusion, the results show that the organoclay additive in phenol-formaldehyde resin glue and impregnation film does not provide effective protection for birch plywood against white and brown rot fungi.",0
194,Reto un apdraudēto augu sugu jūrmalas zilpodzes (Eryngium maritimum L.) un jūrmalas sālsasteres (Aster tripolium L.) audu fenolu saturs un antioksidantu aktivitāte in vitro dzinumu kultūrā atkarībā no nitrātu un saharozes koncentrācijas barotnē,"Sea holly (Eryngium maritimum L.) and sea aster (Aster tripolium L.) are rare and endangered species, which are listed which is listed in Red Data Book of Latvia in the 1st category. Both species are remarkable for valuable natural substances with potential for use in pharmacology, cosmetics and the food industry. The aim of the work was to investigate the effects of different concentrations of sucrose and nitrate in the plant tissue culture medium on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in sea holly and sea aster. The hypothesis was that reduced nitrate concentration and increased sucrose concentration in the medium increase total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of extracts in shoot cultures. In the beginning  juvenile and homogeneous shoots were obtained by propagating them in media with 2.22 μM 6-benzylaminopurine for one month and after that cultivating them in MS medium without any hormonal supplements. Three concentrations of sucrose (40, 20and 10 g L-1) and three concentrations of MS salts containing nitrogen (25%; 50% and 75%) were used. Murashige and Skoog medium nitrogen containing salts were NH4NO3 and KNO3. Sea holly shoot cultures were cultivated for one to two months and sea aster shoot cultures were cultivated 2 months. After the period of cultivation, measurements were carried out to determine the content of the fresh weight, dry weight and chlorophyll content. Total phenolic content as gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per mg g-1 dry weight and the antioxidant activity expressed as Trolox equivalent in μM mg-1 of the dry weight were determined by spectrophotometry method. Reduced levels of MS nitrogen-containing salts and high, normal or reduced sucrose concentrations had no significant effect on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in both plant species. Sea aster had a slight tendency for higher  total phenolic content in media with 75% MS nitrate content but the difference was not statctically significant. Total phenolic content of sea holly shoots ranged from 16.03±1.69 to 18.14±1.10 mg g-1 GAE and the antioxidant content from 1517.0±63.84 to 1592±18.64 μM mg-1 Trolox equivalent but in sea aster shoots total phenolic content ranged from to 13.06±1.82 to 18.62±0.73 mg g-1 GAE and antioxidant content ranged from 1349±52.95 to 1471±88.96 μM mg-1 Trolox equivalent. Different concentratons of sucrose and nitrates had a significant effect on increase of fresh weight, the proportion of water in shoots and chlorophyll content of sea holly shoots, . These factors also had a significant effect on the content of chlorophyll in shoot leaves and water proportion in sea aster shoots.",0
195,Monochamus spp. un citu skujkoku saproksilo vaboļu (Coleoptera) sugu sabiedrības un to ievākšanas metodikas efektivitātes novērtējums kaitīgo organismu riska zonās,"Even though sawyer beetles of Monochamus genus were considered as secondary pests before, their significance in Europe has increased after introduction of pine wood nematode Bursaphelencus xylophilus in Portugal in 1999, as this species vectors. B. xylophilus causes pine wilt disease, which kills large amount of trees. There is no data about occurrence of Monochamus genus and effectivity of pheromone traps in Latvia, which is an important information if there is a need to control B. xylophilus in future in risk zones – territories with higher chance of introduction of pests. The aim of this work is to find out occurrence of sawyer beetles of Monochamus genus in risk zones in Latvia and to evaluate effectivity of pheromone traps for catching conifer saproxylic beetles. The research was done in Latvia in pest risk zones. In 2016 and 2017 in total 76 pheromone traps were used. 31 saproxylic beetle species for which these traps were suitable were caught, including all five European Monochamus genus species – M. galloprovincialis, M. saltuarius, M. sartor, M. sutor and M. urussovi. Sawyer beetles of Monochamus genus are mostly abundant in infrastructure risk zones with forests nearby. Cross traps and funnel traps are suitable for defining saproxylic beetle species diversity, which live on dying trees. Cross traps are more suitable for large beetles, but funnel traps – for scolytids.",0

For example, since 1952 temperature of lake’s hypolimnion has decreased by ~ 4,5 ⁰C while concentration of calcium has increased by 15 mg/l. Important anthropogenic impact is also present as both point and diffuse pollution. It has been historically shown that there is significant disparity of ecological quality of macrozoobenthos between different lake areas with worse being in southeast end of longitudinal lake. However, this study did not find such effect in planktonic communities, except of depressed density of cladocera group compared to the rest of the lake. Most significant differences were observed between two main parts of the lake – west and east, but those were explained by prevalence of large physical sections of deepwater (25 – 46 m) regions of lake, divided by significant relatively shallow (1 – 5 m) middle part. Results describing fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of Ceratium hirundinella showed statistically significant increase of FA in eastern basin, which was also the one with strongest theoreticized pollution influence. However, as FA analysis hasn’t been done in such a way this study describes, it should not be considered as objective argument without further studies. Key words: Lake Ilzas Geraņimovas, temperature of hypolimnion, anthropogenic pollution, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fluctuating asymmetry",0

At least six polymorphisms of this gene - A1555G, C1494T, T1095C, T961G, 961insC(n) and A827G - were associated with aminoglycide induced ototoxicty in whorldwide studies. In this study, 191 ethnic Latvian DNA samples were used. For mutation detection the fragments of mtDNA 12S rRNA gene were sequenced. The results of this study showed that 14 samples carried a mitochondrial mutation, including four pathogenic variants, among which one is related to the H11a mtDNA haplogroup, and two novel variants (G951A and T961A), whose association with ototoxicity risk is still unknown. In total, approximately 5.8% of ethnic Latvians could be exposed to the elevated ototoxicity risk, revealing the need for patients’ genetic screening before aminoglycoside terapy.",0
