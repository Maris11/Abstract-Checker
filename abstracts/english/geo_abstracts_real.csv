1,SEM-EDX metodes izmantošanas iespējas atmosfēras aerosolu sastāva analīzē,"Thesis includes statistical analysis of chemical composition and morphology of particulate matter, supplemented by data of meteorological conditions and air quality, for the purpose to distinguish the emitting sources of atmospheric aerosols. The concentration of 12 chemical parameters (C, O, Fe, Ca, Si, S, Al, Mg, Na, K, Mo, Cl) was determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) at the Institute of Solid State Physics, University of Latvia, but weather observation data and concentration data of gaseous pollutants, and aromatic hydrocarbons, were obtained from the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre observation stations in Riga. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were applied on particle data in order to identify different particle clusters, differentiated on the bases of chemical composition and morphological parameters (carbonate mineral particles, aluminosilicates, soot, sodium chloride, metallic particles). Complementing the analysis with meteorological and air quality data, the possible origin of aerosols was interpreted - soil mineral part, transport, marine aerosols, metallurgy, transboundary pollution and formation of secondary aerosols.",0

4,"Iedzīvotāju izvietojums, mobilitāte un ģentrifikācija: Brasas un Grīziņkalna gadījuma izpēte Rīgā","The bachelor thesis analyses the interplay between gentrification and urban daily mobility behaviour and the spatial extent of both processes. The study examines two neighbourhoods of the city of Riga – Brasa and Grizinkalns. The associated aspects of gentrification and urban geographic mobility have been minimally studied in Latvia, even though residential mobility is an essential element of spatial and social capital. This study discerns the changes in the number and placement of residents and the sociodemographic make-up figures of the neighbourhoods studied. The spatial capital is analysed by examining elements of motility, namely, the mobility behaviour in the research area. This approach highlighted the mutual influence between geographic mobility and residential socio-spatial differentiation. This study employs quantitative study methods, using geographic information system tools. It confirms the importance that spatial capital concerning geographic mobility has for developing the gentrification process in Riga.  This study comprises 4 chapters and 13 sub-chapters.

Information on land use and land use change is further used to calculate other parameters important for the determination of GHG emissions and changes in carbon stock in living and dead biomass, soil and litter, as well as basic information on the impact of applied climate change mitigation measures. Calculations of land use change can be carried out in a partly automated process using geographic information system (GIS) tools, which make calculations easier to perform, reduce time consumption for this task and occasional human errors. The aim of this study is to improve the methodology for the development of land use and land use change matrix in the national GHG inventory system using geospatial data of National forest inventory (NFI) and auxiliary data. This methodology uses geospatial NFI data and auxiliary information provided by the Land parcel information system (LPIS) and stand-wise forest inventory, and it improves the accuracy and consistency of land use and land use change matrix, providing the ability to apply the same land use accounting method for the entire reporting period since 1990 without a significant increase in uncertainty. The developed method determines land use change in a 5-year period by comparing three subsequent NFI cycles. To determine the actual land use category in a specific year, adjustment of weights is performed for different land use categories. Linear interpolation is used to determine year-by-year transitions. The land use change matrix, elaborated in this study, shows similar trends of land use change, if compared to the currently reported data in the National GHG inventory; however, elaboration of the matrix does not require time-consuming manual sorting of change in the NFI plot geometry, which are not associated with actual change in land use. Significant automation of these calculations using GIS tools allows these calculations to be made faster and more precisely.",0

28,Grāvju tīkls Latvijā un tā piemērotība lielam nokrišņu daudzumam,"Most of the long-term operational infrastructure in Latvia, including the drainage ditch network, has been developed before compliance with climate change is included in the planning process. It is therefore essential to obtain accurate data on the condition of the ditch network in order to be able to assess its suitability for foreseeable conditions and the need for improvement measures. The aim of the Master's thesis is to develop a method for the identification of the ditch network and culverts for the needs of surface runoff modeling in Latvian conditions, using remote sensing data, as well as to evaluate the ditch network functionality in cases of extreme precipitation rates. The study area consists of 11 objects throughout Latvia, of which 3 are located on agricultural land and 8 on forest land. Drainage ditch network has been identified using a digital elevation model and technical condition of the ditches are assessed. Using the ditch network, locations of culverts in the aim of elevation model correction, have been identified, as well as the effectiveness of these methods has been assessed. Using the obtained results, hydrological modeling during extreme precipitation was performed. The developed method allows to identify the ditch network with an accuracy of up to 96% on agricultural lands, but on forest lands - 90 to 95% depending on the type of ditches. The technical condition of the ditches can be assessed with the accuracy R2 0,9383 and 0,9462; the depth and width of the ditches, respectively. The study concludes that the ditch network in the research objects on agricultural and forest lands during extreme precipitation, in most cases, is not overloaded and the condition of the existing ditches is not a limiting factor for rainwater drainage.

32,Sentinel-1 sintezētās apertūras radara izmantošana cirsmu konstatēšanai,"In this scientific research, the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data has been studied to detect the felling areas. Analogous studies proving the utilization of SAR and also in particular Sentinel-1 sensors in forestry have been conducted both in the world and in Latvia, but there is a lack of studies that explain the correlation of SAR, forestry processes and weather conditions. Therefore the effect of weather conditions on the received SAR backscatter intensity was researched in this paper, because as the weather changes, so do the dielectric properties of the vegetation and the surface, resulting in a change in the values of the received SAR backscatter. The study was developed because it is important to do forestry monitoring regardless of weather conditions. A model was developed by Sentinel-1 data, ERA5-Land climatic weather reanalysis dataset and multiple regression analysis, that enables to predict the effect of the main dielectric constant influencing weather components on Δσ0 values. This paper proved that the selected weather components in VH polarization can explain 62,7% of Δσ0 values, but in the case of VV polarization, 54,0% of Δσ0 values can be explained. The study showed that VV polarization values, rather than VH polarization values, are more unstable towards vegetation changes, and only VH polarization data can be used for forestry detection, as only VH polarization showed that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean values of forested reference areas and felling areas.",0

The thesis provides an insight into natural grasslands and their protection, as well as the methods for restoring grasslands. The thesis examines the ecology, biology and morphology of the species of the genus yellow rattle and cow-wheat, and the possibilities of their use and the methodology for grasslands restoration. According to data from the Nature Conservation Agency on the range of both genera species in the natural grasslands, the distribution of Rhinanthus spp. and Melampyrum spp. in Latvia's natural grasslands has been discovered, and maps of the species’ occurrence have been created. Moreover, criteria for the assessment of the resources of the yellow rattle seeds in donor grasslands and the consistent application of these criteria to grasslands in the region of GrassLIFE farms have been developed. It has been established that the species of the genus Rhinanthus spp. and Melampyrum spp. are representatives of the natural flora of Latvia which are distributed throughout the territory of Latvia, but the occurrence of the species depends on the geographical location and is most densely present in the geobotanical areas of the Central West and North East of Latvia. The potential of grassland seed resources has only been assessed for yellow rattle, as the use of cow-wheat in the renovation of grasslands lacks research evidence, and therefore, the evaluation of Melampyrum spp. seed resources would not be cost-effective. Using the developed evaluation system for Rhinanthus spp. donor grasslands, it was determined that not all natural grasslands in Latvia, in which a species of the genus is present, are suitable as seed donor territory, However, a large part of the grassland fits the criteria, and its average seed harvesting potential is assessed as medium-good.",0

Forest succession modelling has been performed with a LANDIS II forest simulation model, which has been used for the first time in Latvia and has been validated in the framework of this work. The results of the simulation have been analysed in the Fragstat models, concluding that the occurrence of Populus tremula, Salix caprea and Alnus incana in the landscape depends on the presence of the disturbance, while the Picea abies reduces the prevalence of other species. The current community of tree species is a serial community and is considered to be ecological unstable, and it is constantly changing in certain developmental pathways to reach the growth of monodominants as a society of climax. Consequently, the naturalness reduces the diversity of tree species, whereas forestry activity increases the number and diversity of tree species, which is an indicator of serial community stage. It is concluded that the present conditions in the nature protection zone of the Gauja National Park are effective in promoting the naturalness of the forest landscape, whereas in the strict regime zone of the Gauja National Park they are not effective in ensuring the naturalness.",0
72,Iedzīvotāju novecošanās tendences Latvijas novados,"Grūbe, G. “Population aging trends in Latvian Counties” Master theses. Riga, University of Latvia, Faculty of Geography and Earth Sciences, p 95. In Latvia, significant changes in the population have been observed for a long time. Systematic population decline is a result of natural movement and migration, as well as of rapid population ageing. These trends have an influence on the development of economic, public finances as well as on population number and employment. As the population ages, older individuals become proportionally largest part of the total population, which is one of the most important demographic processes today. Virtually all countries are expected to face an ageing population shortly, yet this will occur at different levels and times. Significant changes can be observed as well in the age structure of the population in Latvia. The working-age population tends to gradually decrease, while the proportion of pensioners is increasing. Such trends will have a significant impact not only on economic and political growth but also on overall regional and national development, as the care of older people requires additional costs for public pensions as well as for health care. The objective of the Master theses is to assess population ageing trends in Latvian Counties. To achieve the objective, the past studies results on population ageing trends were gathered, its expressions and consequences in the world and Latvia were looked at, as well as a statistical analysis of collected data was performed. The assessment of spatial differences of the ageing process of the population was performed based on the newly created cartographic material. The results indicated that a major problem for the future will not only be the population decline but also the consequences of it – the shortage or the less availability of labour, which already causes and will have an even greater impact on the Latvian economy. The Master theses consist of 94 pages, 17 figures, 10 tables and 13 attachments.",0
73,Stāvparku izvietošanas telpiskie risinājumi Rīgā,"Transport emissions are one of the main air pollutants in Riga, thus city’s air quality standards are exceeded every year. To address this, several traffic flow optimization tools are being used – one of the tools often used in Europe is the construction of “Park and Ride” near the city borders. Unfortunately, the development of the “Park and Ride”, which has been planned in Riga for several years, is not being implemented and the problem of congestion and poor air quality remains relevant. The aim of the master's thesis is to evaluate the location of the “Park and Ride” in the planning documents and to develop proposals for their location in Riga. The study concludes that out of the 27 “Park and Ride” planned in Riga development plans, 21 do not meet the main good location conditions - they are located too close to the city center, they do not have good enough public transport connections, or they are located in densely populated neighborhoods, far from city entrances and highways. There is also a lack of public transport lanes in the city, which significantly reduces the potential benefits of the planned “Park and Ride” facilities. The planning of “Park and Ride” in Riga is still incomplete, but positive development tendencies are observed, which are hindered by insufficient cooperation between Riga City Council departments and other institutions. The results of the research are based on surveys, interviews with experts and evaluation of the territorial development planning documents and the “Park and Ride” development plans.",0

129,"Ezeru nogulumu netiešā datēšana, izmantojot sfērisko daļiņu identificēšanas metodi","Bachelor thesis is based on analysis of the identification on fly-ash particles of fossil fuel in the lake sediments, by identifying spherical carbonaceous particles (SCP) and inorganic particles (IAP) in samples, and their use in sediment dating. The study analyses the sediments of two lakes – Lielais Vipedis (Zemgale) and Bricu (Vidzeme). In general, the results show logical changes in spherical (fly-ash) particle concentrations with rapid increases around 1950, maximum concentration around the 1980s and rapid decrease after 1991, explained by political and economic changes over time. The results indicated that concentrations of spherical particles in lakes are affected by sedimentation conditions, but mainly due to historical industrial activity and regional location of industrial sites. The method used in the Bachelor thesis may be applied to date the lake sediments. Additional studies are needed to compare changes in concentrations in other lakes.",0

Nevertheless rising population numbers and pressure on the nature areas and cultural heritage sites is constantly increasing. Urban management and administration is based on rigid legislation instruments and technical engineering solutions. Consequently cities become rigorous and human-controlled systems that lose the ability to adopt to unpredictable external factors. The loss of city’s cultural and historical face leaves an undesirable mark on place identity and well - being issues. This research focuses on urban green infrastructure restoration and integration in the surrounding landscape, taking into consideration social and cultural heritage issues. Additionally, this work will research various case studies that could serve as an additional source of data not only to complement theoretical background overview but also integrate practical examples into research results by providing recommendations for urban green infrastructure planning.

174,Plastmasas atkritumu pārstrāde un tās nodrošināšana Latvijā,"The master’s thesis “Plastic Waste Recycling and the Provision Thereof in Latvia” analyses plastic waste management in Latvia, the aims thereof on the scale of the European Union, as well as the final status requirements for plastic waste. By carrying out the analysis of national guidelines for polymer waste recycling, the author has compared EU recycling requirements with the practical possibilities of recycling. During the research, the author visited the PET recycling company “PET Baltija” in Jelgava and the municipal waste sorting station and polygon “Brašķi” in Līvbērze Parish. The author analysed the process of waste collection in Latvia, as well as the import of waste from abroad, thus identifying currently existing problems and offering solutions. In Latvia, plastic waste is mainly recycled by “PET Baltija” who work with PET bottles and by “Nordic Plast” who work with film and various polymers (Eco Baltia 2014). Having visited waste recycling companies, as well as having studied the industry and inspected the best EU practices, the author has analysed and suggested what type of polymers could be additionally recycled in Latvia and what type of impact the changes would have on the environment and the economy. The paper comprises conclusions that are based on specific measurements and the examination of practical recycling technologies. The master’s thesis includes an overview and analysis of waste collection and sorting examples from abroad, as well as suggestions for waste management improvements in Latvia. One of the main points for ensuring quality plastic recycling is the sorting of plastic waste by type after the collection thereof. The paper identifies various types of household waste and inspects what type of plastic waste and in what amount a household generates over a specific period of time, also establishing what type of polymers are the most common ones. The quantity of each type of plastic was determined by sorting and weighing. The master’s thesis includes an analysis of plastic packaging that forms the largest part of plastic waste on a daily basis. Plastic packaging consists of the following types of polymers and marking: polyethylene terephthalate – PET 1; high-density polyethylene – HDPE 2; polyvinyl chloride – PVC 3; low-density polyethylene – LDPE 4; polypropylene – PP 5; polystyrene – PS 6; and other polymers – 7 (Plastmasa 2009). In Latvia, mainly PET and PE is recycled, as well as a small amount of PP and PS. At the same time, the population produces the following types of plastic waste in the respective amounts: PET – 35.65%, HDPE – 12.17%, PVC – 0.09%, LDPE – 10.34%, PP – 24.24%, PS – 5.05%, other – 12.47% (in households over a span of two weeks). In contrast, the waste sorting station and polygon “Brašķi” sorts the following amount of plastic waste from municipal waste: PET – 27.98%, HDPE – 0.56%, PVC – 0.00%, LDPE – 31.80%, PP – 13.48%, PS – 0.00%, other – 3.37%, as well as 22.81% of plastic that is unidentifiabl",0

It is expected that the higher summer temperatures will affect the quality of life of people in cities, as well as the demand for refreshments. As urbanization develops, urban areas become complex network systems with a specific structure and increased human activity. Environmental changes and developments always affect the microclimate. In turn, climate change can have various effects on the environment and citizens, such as the impact on health, increased energy consumption in buildings, changing understanding of vegetation and landscape design. In order to understand the city's microclimate, it is important to look at the type of building and its characteristics, as well as the meteorological parameters. One of the factors that irrevocably changes and is very important for a person's well-being is the thermal comfort. It is well known that it is possible to build a climate-appropriate design, reducing the heat stress at street level and energy consumption, resulting in a positive effect on health, social, economic and environmental aspects. Spatial and temporal characterization of thermal comfort characterization indicators is described in the Master's thesis using mathematical modeling methods. The pilot area was chosen for the research - densely built city center district of Riga (Raina Boulevard 19), surrounded by a square. A specialized computer program ENVI-met was used to model the variability of features. The results show that the direct solar radiation is a major influence on the microclimate and thermal comfort.
