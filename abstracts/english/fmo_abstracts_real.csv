6,Akomodācijas un verģences sistēmas darbības traucējumu izplatība Azerbaidžānā,"Each year, increasing demand for energy, in regards to the increasing global population and non-stopping industrialisation, leads to a search for ways to acquire energy in the most environmentally friendly way. Gasification is expected to become more demanding as a way of generating energy in the future, since the use of different types of biomass, including organic waste, can be used as a raw material to avoid the over-consumption of fosil fuels. While gasification is a long-known way of generating energy, its control is complicated. In recent years, mathematical models have been used to better understand and optimize the process, which can predict the effects of changing different parameters on the process. Euler-Lagrange method using ANSYS Fluent software was used to create a simplified 2D entrained flow gasifier model. The calculation showed that the model created was able to predict the dependency of the composition of syngas on the various amounts of oxidant. However, the model only yielded good results in the diapazon of low temperatures.",0

9,Siltuma ģenerēšanas un pārneses procesu modelēšana grafos,"In this thesis numerical calculations of paramagnetic particle movement in a rotating magnetic field are made. In the model particles are in a viscous fluid and have one axis magnetic anisotropy. Movement of particles in chain can be divided in modes where particle anisotropy axis rotates synchronously and asynchronously with the field. The stability of chain due to the mode of the movement of the particles is studied. Maximal or critical length of a stable rotating chain has been obtained depending on the field rotation frequency for different particle anisotropy parameters. These numerical results have been compared with analytical results. Randomly arranged particles form planes in the rotating field. In these planes particles create chains.

The peculiarity of survival data is censoring, which must be considered when choosing statistical methods. A classic problem of survival analysis is the comparison of the distribution functions of two samples, which is performed with the Mantel test, while the test of the difference or the ratio of two medians can be used to compare the medians. For these tests, simulations were performed to approximate the theoretical limiting distribution, to determine the level of empirical significance and the accuracy of the confidence interval coverage, as well as to describe their application to practical survival data. The paper also discusses the adaptation of the two-sample empirical likelihood function method to censored data, as a result of which, it can be applied to any parameter of interest that can be expressed as a functional of the survival function. Several possible applications of the method are presented, for example, comparison of survival probabilities, p-quintiles, mean survival time and mean residual life comparison. Limiting distribution simulations for the empirical likelihood function method have been performed and empirical 95% critical values was obtained for several scenarios of censoring proportions and sample sizes for three of the proposed applications. The application of the empirical likelihood method to a real data set is given.",0
15,Divu izlašu salīdzināšana izdzīvošanas datu analīzē,"By adding microcapsules with active fillers, such as thermochromic or photochromic, into polymers, smart materials with sensor functions could be created. Such microcapsule fillers contain dyes that degrade and lose their color saturation when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, because of radiation that is destructive to molecular bonds of dyes. Thus, the with incorporation of smart functions to materials, their practical usage now depends on whether there is UV radiation. The aim of the work is to evaluate the effect of UV light on the service-life of microcapsulated thermochromic and photochromic filament. To reach this aim, polymer samples with added thermochromic and photochromic microcapsules were produced. These samples were subjected to UV exposure under a Hg UV lamp and it was possible to determine a critical time when microcapsules could no longer serve their purpose as color-changing indicators, as the color change effect was gone. UV radiation coming from the UV lamp was compared to UV radiation coming from the sun, therefore it was possible to predict microcapsule stability under the natural solar radiation. After undoubtedly confirming color change under UV exposure, microcapsule samples were covered with polymer coats and put under UV lamp exposure. As a result, it was concluded that polymer coats can extend the service-life of microcapsules when used under a UV source, such as the sun.",0

One of the key problems in this technology are the currently relatively high ope-ration temperatures which e.g. require special materials. A temperature reduction couldsignificantly decrease the price, and also increase the efficiency of fuel cell devices. Thiscould be achieved using protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFC). Electrolyte materials for PCFChave attracted much attention in the literature [1]. However, selection of an efficient catho-de material with sufficiently high electronic and protonic conductivity is crucial for PCFCperformance. Recently, perovskite cathode materials for PCFC were considered in compre-hensive experimental studies [2]. Such materials belong to the family of multi-component(Ba,Sr,La)(Fe,Co,Zn,Y)O3–perovskites.In the present work, we develop the methodology to study in detail the two parent perov-skites LaCoO3and BaCoO3where Co ions reveal formal oxidation states ranging from 4+ to3+. Using first principle calculations and several hybrid density functionals for comparison,as realized in the CRYSTAL code, we carefully analyze their fundamental bulk properties,such as bond lengths and lattice distortions. Special emphasis is laid on the complex mag-netic properties and the electronic/band structure.

We are already familiar with a variety of methods used for consistent effect estimation on a continues outcome. However, both, effect and outcome, are in most cases influenced by one or more covariates that we may not always be able to identify. We will consider methods that use several sub-models to be included in one union model to be protected against uncontrolled confounding. In order to use these estimators in practice, it is necessary to make important assumptions and understand confounding as such. Furthermore, we will look into different scenarios of misspecified sub-models of doubly and multiply robust estimation and apply these models on simulated data.

93,Vizuālās informācijas ietekme uz sāpju slieksni.,"Global warming and other climate change have a serious impact on the overall economic system, particularly the agricultural and forestry sectors. Therefore, there is a growing need for a scientifically based climate forecast for the coming years, directly at regional level. Information on climate change is derived from global climate models, but is generated with high resolution and therefore not sufficiently representative of regional climate change. Bias correction methods are used to reduce the deviation between global climate models and actual observations.  In order to make the correction of the deviation as accurate as possible, a homogenous observation time series is required. A homogeneous time series is time series whose variation occurred only because of climatic conditions and not due to the movement of the observation station and other conditions. Since not all information that may affect the quality of the observations has been retained in writing, statistical methods are used to help assess whether the changes have occurred. The main element of these methods is to find change points, so the work focuses on change point detection methods.",0

As of previous works by J. Schwarz \cite{Schwarz:2014zsa}, J. Maldacena \cite{Maldacena:1998im} and R. Myers \cite{Myers:1999ps} for extremal solutions, we start with D3 probe brane extremal prescription in $ AdS_{5} \times S^{5} $ and later modify the geometry by introduction of blackening factor to the metric which introduces presence of the event horizon (black brane), which leads to problems of existence of finite temperature solutions and their interpretation. In the extremal case exact solutions are known and they correspond to soliton solutions Dyonic BIons since they carry both electric and magnetic charges on the field side they correspond to $ \dfrac{1}{2} $-BPS solutions. However finite temperature framework provides us with highly nonlinear setting, hence EOM are solved numerically and stable solutions are found to be consistent with system back reaction to the presence of blackhole analogue. We also discuss extra solutions which are expected to correspond to finite temperature version of \cite{Schwarz:2014zsa}, existence of phase transition, holographic duals and generalisation of nonextremal (complete construction) BIon.",0

In simple terms, these devices turn the heat into electricity. It is a convenient way to transform waste energy into the desired electrical energy. However, such devices are rare nowadays due to their low utility and other factors. Thermoelectric generators most often consist of different connections of separate n and p type semiconductor elements to increase output current and voltage as needed. In this case, string circuit of n-type bismuth selenide and p-type antimony telluride is considered in different configurations relative to the temperature gradient. To increase the efficiency of these devices, the main tasks are to reduce their resistance and thermal conductivity. One way to do this is to build generators from very thin layers of these semiconductors, because, it turns out, these materials are topological insulators. This means that their surfaces are highly electrically conductive, but there is band gap in the volume. So, the very thin films of these semiconductors will have a more pronounced electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient than the volume materials, which will result in greater efficiency of the thermoelectric generator. An additional benefit is the ability to build this device in relatively small sizes. In the study, the thermoelectric properties of thin films were analyzed using a physical properties measurement system. Thickness measurements were made using a atomic force microscope and the chemical composition was determined using an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. For the thermoelectric generator, the overall coefficient of Seebeck was measured. For the thermoelectric generator, the total Seebeck coefficient and the maximum power at a constant temperature gradient were measured.",0

165,Acs aberācijas un mirkšķināšana,"The bachelors thesis is written on 30 pages. It contains 14 images, 3 attachments, 41 referenes to the literature. Aim of the thesis: To determine the quality of blinking and tear film on the higher order aberrations of the eye. Hypothesis of the tesis: The quality of the tear film has a high impact on making higher order aberrations – the more a person blinks and the worse the quality of the tear film is, the larger is growth of an higher order aberrations. Tasks of the thesis: 1.To determine the frequency of blinking and its impact on how fast the tear film breaks; 2.To measure the aberration scene and analyse its change between the 4 measurments; 3.To analyse the impact of frequency of blinking and the tear film quality on the change of higher order aberrations. Participants: 15 women in the age of 20 to 25 years participated. None of the participants are in the risk group of dry eye and in everyday life don’t use tear drops and therapies of medicaments. Method: There were 2 surveys fot the participants: „McMonnies” and „OSDI”, to assure that eyes are in good condition and that the participants are not in the risk group of dry eye. The frequency of blinking and the time of tear film breaking were scaled (TBUT – tear brake up time) with the invasive method. With the help of i.ProfilerPlus each participant was measured in 4 different time cathegories and scenes of the corneal higher order aberrations were scaled. Conclusions: In a time period of  10-12 seconds while the tear film is drying, the higher order aberrations increases from 0,19 to 1,74 µm, which corresponds to the determination of quality of tear film on complete function of optical system of the eye. A tear film in bad quality brings to a remarkable growth of optical system`s errors, which brings to weakening the quality of the vision from 0,25 up to 2,50 D. A more frequent blinking brings a faster drought of the tear film, which means that the growth of aberration is higher in a shorter time period. If the blinking frequency is lower and the quality of tear film is higher, the impact of aberration on the maintance of vision decreases",0

193,Starpzvaigžņu putekļu virsmas un mantijas ķīmisko procesu makroskopiskā Montekarlo modelēšana,"Observations of the interstellar medium show that in cold conditions (T~10 K) a coat of ice around interstellar dust cores forms from surrounding gas. This coat of ice can be chemically differentiated two parts: surface and mantle. This icy surface an mantle allows complex molecules to form in the interstellar medium. Models for dust grain mantle reactions and diffusion need to be developed for the simulation of chemical kinetics, because of new spectroscopic data coming about the formation of complex molecules with the help of interstellar grain mantle processes. It is well known that interstellar dust grains consist of a small amount of molecules compared to the interstellar gas. Therefore, the effect of reagent fluctuation in the interstellar grains needs to be taken into account when considering the chemical kinetics of the interstellar medium. In this thesis, a macroscopic model for interstellar ice mantle diffusion and mantle reactions is developed. The reactions are simulated with Gillespie’s algorithm, which models reactions as Markov chain processes and takes into account the fluctuation of reaction reagents. This approach allows a larger reaction network and more reagents to be included in the simulation than other microscopic approaches. The physical conditions of a cold collapsing translucent molecular cloud, which collapses to a cold dark cloud, are considered. These conditions are important in understanding the chemical development stages of protostars. The calculations in this thesis show that the model describes the growth of the ice mantle pretty well, but the evaluated reaction rates for mantle photodissociation are estimated too high in the model.  In conclusion, this model is a step in the positive direction in developing a macroscopic approach for diffusion and reaction in the ice mantle.",0
