Within the framework of research there was created an additional question for children about how they value their relationship with their parents. The results of the study show that there is a positive statistically significant correlation between how the child self-assesses their compulsive internet habits and how their parent evaluates them, as well as there is a statistically significant relationship between parents assessed emotional warmth as an approach of parenting and the quality of relationships in the child's assessment. Children's assessment of the child's-parent's relationship statistically significantly predicts the child's compulsive Internet use symptoms indicating that the child's assessment of emotionally warm relationships with parents can predict a reduction in the child's compulsive Internet use symptoms.

Language acquisition must be such that a child willingly wants to talk in it.  The aim of the diploma is to explore and analyse ways to develop, to teach speaking skills in English in primary school, particularly in second grade.

Family plays an important role in the formation of first sounds, words, and concepts.  Subsequently, language is further developed through peer interactions (e.g., playing, conversing, studying) in various social settings, such as daycare and school.  Adult supervision is important to make necessary linguistic corrections. When pronunciation disorders are observed, it is important to find the underlying causes so that they are prevented early. Children with phonemic disorders experience greater difficulty learning the language and therefore reading.  Based on scientific literature, this thesis examines different phonemic disorder types and causes, and suggests remedies that will help a child develop and improve phonemic hearing and perception. Following methodological literacy recommendations, the corrective lessons for promoting student reading skills are created.  Finally, the data reveals that reading skills are more likely to improve with timely phonemic perception development.  Research is described on 93 pages. It includes 16 pictures, 20 tables, 97 references and 83 appendixes that have used 23 literature and other references. Keywords: reading skills, reading skill development, Grade 1 and 2 students with phonemic disorders.",0

82,Ožas maņa multisensorās mācīšanās pieejā: sākumskolas skolotāju vērtējums,"Neuroscience research shows that multisensory learning approach is the most effective and natural way of learning. This approach involves simultaneous use of two or more senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell) in an active cognitive process. In the Western culture, under the influence of cultural, historical and social factors, sight and hearing were declared as the “highest” senses, devaluing the sense of smell and neglecting it in terms of research, attitude and use. This factor has also directly affected the field of education: the sense of smell, along with the sense of taste, is the least purposefully used and integrated sense in the learning pro-cess.  The aim of this Master's Thesis is to promote the use of the sense of smell in the learning process, within the framework of the multisensory learning approach. This is done, firstly, through in-depth scientific research and literature analysis, and secondly, by exploring the primary school teachers’ understanding and assessment of the integration of multisensory learning approach in general and olfactory sense in particular in the learning process. As a re-sult of the research, several conclusions were drawn and some recommendations were made for the teachers about the possible use of the sense of smell in the learning process.

87,Uzmanības attīstības pedagoģiskie risinājumi bokseriem 12 - 15 gadu vecumā,"The object of the research is pedagogical solutions for attention development in 12-15 years old boxers. Such solutions are needed to make the training process more effective and to make young Latvian boxers more successful at the international ring. The goal of the thesis is to research pedagogical solutions for attention development in 12-15 years old boxers. The objectives of the thesis are •to find out what types of pedagogical theories are used during the boxer training process; •to find out how the boxer’s attention is manifested during the trainings and what processes it is involved in during the trainings and competitions; •to develop questionnaire for coaches; •to interview coaches and to find out ohow important they think the development of attention in boxers is; ohow attention is connected with other boxers’ qualities; oif coaches know and use any effective exercises to develop attention; oif coaches know and use methods and techniques to assess the level of attention of the boxer; •to analyze the interviews; •to develop recommendations for coaches and sportsmen. Based on the literature analysis, behaviorism and human pedagogy have the most impact on the pedagogical process in box. Behaviorism is about the conditional reflexes, which appears based on the “stimulus-reaction” principle. Human pedagogy allows to educate boxers in their zone of proximal development. It is also important, when the most important condition for a boxer's victory is his motivation. While researching boxers’ performance and the related processes, it was found out that attention is highly important in all processes related to boxing. Most often attention is connected to •eyesight, •time of reaction, •the ability to observe the performance of the opponent (this means one needs to observe several objects of attention, while the situation constantly changes), •the ability to control and change one’s movements at a high speed (coordination and dexterity). Based on the analysis of the literature, the questionnaire was developed. The coaches were interviewed using the questionnaire. Based on the results of the interviews it was found out that coaches do not spend enough time training boxers’ attention. Coaches do not have enough information about the importance of attention in boxers’ performance. Most often coaches connect attention to boxer’ reaction rate (simple and complex). Coaches were recommended to focus more on cooperation with sprostmen and to work with young sportsmen’s motivation. It is recommended to  measure simple and complex reaction rates and adjust the training process based on that. Most effectively attention develops during the training fight and during competitions. A selection of specific exercises was made that are meant to help develop attention. E.g., Schulte tables which are used to train concentration and focus switchin, as well as to widen one’s vision span.",0

The study revealed that Latvia’s normative acts do not grant any support for these students while other of the countries define support measures differently. Students were interviewed to find out how these support systems work in practice. From them it was concluded that the most thoughtful support is in Finland and Canada. Students in Germany have not used much support so the efficiency of the system cannot be judged. Reasons were studied for students choosing to reveal to the university about their disability.

The author of the master's work is Nadezhda Rachkova. This study is current, because there are less studies that are devoted to the improvement of students’ monologic skills of minorities students who learn Latvian language, but the requirements for minorities students when forming monologic expressions in Latvian (in each stage of mastering the language) are much higher than in a foreign language, they are close to the requirements in native language. However, the didactic ways how to achieve these requirements differ from those that are assumed in the methods of native and foreign languages. The aim of the study is to research the didactic possibilities to improve the verbal monologic speech in Latvian language of minorities students from grade 6. The master paper consists of two parts – theoretical and empiric.  The meaning of lingual personality, role of monologic speech during the process of learning Latvian is analysed theoretically; linguodidactic experiences of scientists are summarized where methods and techniques for improvement of students’ monologic skills in second language are in the centre; difficulties are characterized that the students encounter when creating verbal texts during learning a second language. The study is based on theoretical opinions of J. Karaulovs, V. Vinogradovs, I. Halejeva, N. Gaļskova, N.Geza, Z. Anspoka, I. Alekse, V.Strautiņa, D. Šulce,  and other authors. Results of questionnaires of Latvian language teachers and results of assessment of verbal monologic speech of students from grade 6 are summarized and analysed in the practical part of the maser paper.

Yet, students are asked to challenge their English reading skills in centralised examination (CE) in Grade 9 and 12, thus it seems reasonable to strive for improvement of reading comprehension in a foreign language, too. As foreign language acquisition is connected with native language comprehension, meta-cognitive approach is favoured nowadays, one of the meta-cognitive strategies advised is called Reading Detectives, which focuses on cognition strategies, when students are exposed to challenging texts. The aim of the Diploma Paper is to examine how the particular strategy can improve students’ reading comprehension in English lessons in Grade 7.  The research method is a case study that involves the author’s journal entries, Meta-cognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI) questionnaire carried out among students before and after implementing Reading Detective strategy and semi-structured interviews with three subject related teachers of School X, also, before and after the strategy implementation process.  It was found that there are several activities within Reading Detective strategy to improve reading comprehension, used not only in language related subjects as the strategies are used depending on the purpose, that is, either to summarize, visualize, recall, decode or organize. Among the activities contributing to the development of reading comprehension are word and context clues, story detective game, summary wheel, story wheel (map) strategy, character trait summary chart, Venn diagram, summary wheel with questions, discussions and role-play story detective game, which positively correlates with the development of meta-cognitive strategies, namely, Support Reading, Global, and Problem-Solving.  Together with the data gained in the research about the activities underlying Reading Detective strategy for promoting reading comprehension in Form 7, the Diploma Paper can be used as a guideline for teachers, working on reading comprehension skills in the classroom either on regular basis or with students from special education.",0
