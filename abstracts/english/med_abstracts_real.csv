Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted among dental professionals working in clinics, located in different regions of the Republic of Latvia. Questionnaire was created to obtain the necessary information regarding the use of MTA and Biodentine in conservative dentistry and endodontics. The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Institute of Cardiology and Regenerative Medicine of the University of Latvia. Results: Total amount of 105 completed questionnaires were received from the respondents and are the subject of this research. Respondents, were general dentists (N=87;82,9%), endodontists (N=12;11,4%) and pediatric dentists (N=6;5,7%). Work experience of clinicians varied from less than 1 year to more than 15 years. Regarding the question about preferred biomaterial: 36 dentists (34,3%) selected MTA, 9 dentists (8,6%) Biodentine, 39 dentists (37,1%) both biomaterials and 21 dentists (20%) answered, that they don’t use biomaterials at all. During the course of treatment, clinicians use bioactive agents mostly for pulp capping procedure (N=84;35%), followed by perforation repair (N=75;31,25%), pulpotomy (N=39;16,25%) and retrograde surgical filling (N=36;15%). Statistical interaction was observed in between the use of Biodentine, its capacity to preserve pulp vitality (p=0,0004) and ability to initiate dentine remineralization (p=0,0055). Interesting that, the main criteria for not using Biodentine appeared to be high cost (p=0,0002). Statistical relation was detected in between the use of MTA, its ability to set in the moist environment (p=0,0025) and preserve pulp vitality (p=0,0157). This research also indicated that, the main reason for not using MTA was difficult handling characteristics (p=0,0006). Conclusions: The results of conducted study show, that there are variety of factors contributing to the selection of particular agent. It could, however, be determined that, MTA is used for all clinical applications, but mostly for perforation repair and as a root end filling material. In its turn, Biodentine is more frequently used for vital pulp therapy procedures.",0

Materials and methods: In the retrospective analysis, the data were collected using the data base from Jelgava Psychoneurological Hospital “Ģintermuiža”, Latvia. Clinical data were collected from paper medical records of patients with the diagnosis of SUD and screened for nonmedical use of BZDs. Descriptive statistics were done by using Microsoft Excel and SPSS Statistic software. Results: There were 52 patients of age 14 to 53 years old involved in the study: 10 were females and 42 were males. The main admission diagnosis according to ICD classification included mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (4%), opioids (21%), cannabinoids (2%), sedatives or hypnotics (11%) and multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances (62%). As a primary drug of abuse were opioids (44%), cannabinoids (25%), alcohol (12%), amphetamines (6%), tranquilizers (11%) and cocaine (2%). All patients had history of BZDs misuse in their anamnesis. Clonazepam was the most common drug used among SUD patients (58%). The dosage of Clonazepam fluctuated from 4 mg to 60 mg per day that exceeds therapeutic dosage.   Conclusions: In patients with SUD BZDs abuse and nonmedical use is a common problem. BZDs are usually being used as a secondary psychoactive substance in addition to other drugs to increase effects or reduce unwanted side effects. Patients with SUD tend to increase the therapeutic doses of BDZs for abuse purposes, but some of them are limited to therapeutic doses. This study could serve as a basis for more extensive research and further research of this topic would be needed to obtain convincing results.",0

The data assesed is taken from VSIA “TOS” registry. This is a retrospective study of the data regarding endoprosthetic operations completed in VSIA “TOS” since February 2012.   Firstly, at  April 29th 2020, there were sorted 511 total knee arthroplasty revision surgeries. Each revision then was identified in the primary TKA registry, with 410 revisions left, which were completed in  VSIA “TOS”. 50 revisions were excluded as there was no primary TKA case found for those in the database. Another 123 revisions were excluded as they were not the first-time revisions. There were 109 revisions left for analysis. Mean age of the patient for the primary TKA was  68,76 years and 65,94 years for revision patients . BMI could not be analyzed as there were not enough records regarding it in the database. Osteoarthritis was found to be the main cause of the primary EP with 94,7% cases to it, and in the TKA revisions with 84,4% of cases. Osteoarthritis in combination with other diseases accounted to 2,7% of the cases. The statistics then were followed by the posstraumatic arthritis (0,7%), gonitis (0,6%) and other pathologies.  Major part of the patients that underwent primary or revision TKA’s were classifieable to ASA II or III.  While evaluating the time for which the antibacterial prophylaxys was given before the primary TKA, the revisions were divided in 2 groups – those associated with infection , and those that are not. It was found that the revision that happened due to the infection, had antibacterial prophylaxys admitted for a shorter time , mean 51,82 minutes. Those revision cases that were not associated with infection had it admitted for a, mean 64,16 minutes  12 (11%) of  109 revisions that were analyzed had a previous history of knee or surrounding tissue surgery. However, local complications after after primary TKA were found in only one (0,9%) of the revisions.   Main cause of the revision was infection (60% of the cases) , then followed by the aseptic loosening gadījumu (10,1%) , periprosthetic fractures (9,2%) and other pathologies. The incidence of revision calculated for one years was 1,03%  and for two years, it was 1,60%. Five year incidence was 3,1% . Calculation of 10 and 15-years incidence was not possible due to the registry existing only since February 2020.",0

Treatment choices depend on the type and stage of the tumor, as well as the general condition of the patient. Surgical intervention is the main choice of treatment but, unfortunately, intraoperative and postoperative factors usually become a cause of patient’s death in the  early postoperative period. (Bray et al., 2018)  The aim of the study is to find out the influence of demographic and intraoperative factors in the early postoperative period.  Materials and methods: In this retrospective research we analyzed 62 patients who have been diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent open right hemicolectomy. During the study we have collected anamnestic data, operative protocols and histology descriptions. All the information has been analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics v25 software.  Results: The study of 62 patients included 55% of females and 45% of males. They were from different age groups with a mean value of 71.5 years. Postoperative complications were observed in 11 patients (17.7%). Wound infection was present in 8 patients (12.9%). The average length of stay in the hospital was 16 days. No statistically significant correlations (p> 0.05) were found in the analysis of the effect of gender and age on surgical wound infection. Operation time and length of excised intestine have no statistically significant effect on the development of postoperative complications (p> 0.05). There is no significant correlations between postoperative hemoglobin concentration and total length of hospital stay (P> 0.05)  Conclusions: 1. Demographic factors do not affect the development of wound infection. 2. The frequency of postoperative complications does not depend on the time of surgery and the size of the removed intestine. 3. The hemoglobin level in the blood is not a factor that can affect the total length of  stay in hospitals.",0

Depression has been shown to adversely affect the outcome of diabetes and lower quality of life (Holt et al., 2014). Studies about depression association with diabetes complications are increasing each year. The aim: to investigate and clarify the association between the presence and progression of depression and type 1 diabetes complications (nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease) in the prospective study “LatDiane”.. Methods: in this prospective study 121 participants with type 1 diabetes were included. BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) questionnaire were used for depression evaluation. Only patients who came to the follow-up visit were included in the study. The required patient data were obtained from “LatDiane” study. Patient recruitment for the “LatDiane” was forom 2013 to 2016, and patients were invited to the follow-up visit after 3-6 years. IMB SPSS Statistics v.26 program were used for data processing. Results: a total of 121 people participated in the study, 52 men (43.8%) and 68 women (56.2%). The average age was 36.7 years (SD 13.1 years). The average age for women was 38.1 years (SD 14.2 years), for men 34.9 years (SD 11.3 years). The average duration of diabetes is 18.0 years, SD 11.8 years. Microalbuminuria (19.8%) was found in 24 subjects, macroalbuminuria in 3 subjects (2.5%) and end stage renal disease in 2 subjects (1.7%). Non-proliferative retinopathy was present in 14 subjects (11.6%) and proliferative in 37 subjects (30.6%). 9 persons (7.4%) had cardiovascular diseases, respectively 112 persons (92.6%) did not. The average BDI score at the recruitment visit was 8.3 (SD 7.7 points). Mild depression was present in 21 persons (17.4%), major depression in 20 persons or 16.5%. For most people, at the follow-up visit depression stage didn’t change (85 people in total), the depression stage worsened for 20 people, depression class decreased for 16 people. Changes in BDI scores over 3-6 years (BDI point difference) did not find a statistically significant association with the progression of complications (p = 0.165).  There were no statistically significant associations with the degree of depression at the recruitment visit with progression of nephropathy and retinopathy (p = 0.719 and p = 0.449). But the degree of depression had statistically significant association with cardiovascular disease progression (p = 0.021). There was no statistically significant association between depression stage and nephropathy progression (p = 0.608), retinopathy progression (p = 0.114) and cardiovascular disease progression (p = 0.315). Conclusions: Changes in BDI scores do not impact the progression of complications. A more severe stage of depression at the recruitment visit affects the progression of cardiovascular disease, but at the follow-up visit does not affect the progression of any complications.

Sadly, still there are no significant data   that would approve additional therapy options, that would prevent arthroscopy complication-synovitis. This is the reason , why in this research i would like to show as many as possible already  done abstracts that are related to sodium hyaluronate affect,  possible effect or quite the opposite of that in terms of rehabilitation after operation. The goal was to make  such kind of a research also in Latvia. In this research the biggest attention was to ultrasonographic examination data. This data would prove or disapprove the hypothesis of this abstract, that sodium hyaluronate injection in the knee joint right after operation, could prevent process of synovitis. Addition to that, data was collected from knee range of motion examination, specifically extension and flexion in knee joint, also patient’s pain levels before and after operation. Data analysis was done retrospectively. Collected results after the analysis, quite sadly, did not match research expectations. That said, hypothesis was not supported.  No significant statistic evidence that would prove correlation between injection affect on post-operative synovitis prevention was found (p = 0,23). That means that sodium hyaluronate does not have evidence based effect of reducing risk of synovitis development. No significant statistic evidence was also found regarding range of motion. Knee joint flexion dynamic (p= 0,95),  extension (p = 0,35) and pain dynamic data analysis (p = 0,67).

For this purpose, the DNA construct encoding the catalytic domain of S. epidermidis sortase A has been created by inserting the sortase A gene into pET22b and pET28a vectors. Proteins have been expressed by IPTG induction in Escherichia coli system (BL21). A non-tagged Sortase A (expressed in the pET22b vector) has been purified by anion exchange while His6-tagged Sortase A (expressed in the pET28a vector) has been purified by immobilized metal affinity and size exclusion chromatography. The activity of the enzyme and the potency of its inhibitors have been determined using FRET analysis (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO) measuring fluorescence of Abz-LPETG-K-(DPN) and Dabcyl-LPETG-Edans (GL Biochem) peptide cleavage products. As a result, the sortase A gene has been successfully inserted into pET28a and pET22b vectors to express His6-tagged and non-tagged sortase A, respectively. In total, 1600 drug-like compounds have been screened using FRET analysis. The preliminary screening resulted in selecting of 23 compounds, that have shown >50% of relative inhibition of Se-SrtA protein. To reduce false-negative results further studies have been done to measure the confidence interval. During the next screening phase, only 15 compounds have shown the similar result. Finally, 4 compounds with the significant relative inhibition of Se-SrtA have been selected for NMR as well as cytotoxic and cell invasive studies to proceed to further in vivo studies.",0

The number of radical prostatectomies (RP) in Latvia is increasing. Two types of procedure are used: open and laparoscopic RP. It is necessary to evaluate which procedure will give the patient better results after the operation and will not change the quality of life after the operation. Aim: Understand which surgical approach has fewer complications and less impact on patient quality of life. Methods: Prospective study. The survey research method was used. Patients underwent elective surgery with two groups - open RP and laparoscopic RP. The RLP group included 23 participants and the RRP group included 20 participants. Prior to surgery, patients were introduced to the procedure to be performed. They were explained that there are two types of operations. Patients were asked to participate in the study, explaining the purpose of the study. Patients were issued an informed consent form at Riga Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital in ward 4, by signing which they will agree to participate in the study. If the patient agrees, he or she had to provide his or her contact telephone number so that he or she could call and have a telephone interview in a month. During the interviews, questions were asked that are prepared for the study. After collecting the obtained data, it was studied how complications have affected the quality of life of each member of the group and compared how long there were complications after surgery. Results: The study included 43 patients and all were included in the statistical analysis. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed in 23 patients, or 53.5%, and open radical prostatectomy was performed in 20 patients, which is 46.5%.  For postoperative pain, the question was answered by all study participants and t Student's test with p = 0.05 was used. On average, pain persisted for 6 days in RLP patients, compared with 10.45 days in RRP patients. Significance level p = 0.002, which confirms the established hioptesis that there are statistically significant differences in pain duration. To the question, ""How long did you have incontinence after removing the Foley catheter?"" Were answered by all study participants and a student test with p = 0.05 was used. On average, RLP patient incontinence persisted for 11.78 days, while RRP patient had 15.45 days. Significance level p = 0.136, which does not support the hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference for incontinence.  Conclusion: Comparing the results of the statistical analysis of the data, it may seem that there is not much difference between the two procedures, RLP and RPP. The fact that there is one statistically significant indicator that shows that the patient's quality of life has improved and also that there is a tendency for other indicators to have better outcomes after RLP suggests that this method should be chosen.",0

One major problem is that there is no treatment, besides joint replacement, which can cure osteoarthritis, that is why it is important to investigate alternative treatment methods such as stem cell therapy. The interest towards the research of mononuclear cells as a treatment method is widely increasing but still only a little is known about the optimal quantity of mononuclear cells injected and why the mononuclear and mesenchymal stem cell quantity and quality differs between people. Aims of the research is to see if there are any correlations between patient factors, such as age, sex, erythrocytes, hemoglobin and thrombocytes, and the quantity of mononuclear cells, CD34+ cells and the percentage of CD34+ cells. Gončars et al. (2018) did a great research using autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells as a treatment method for knee osteoarthritis. They observed a wide yield of extracted mononuclear cells (8.3 x 106 – 158 x 106) even though the same harvesting and cell processing method was used.

This study will examine information on the gender and age-specific incidence of allergic and non-allergic asthma and correlation with other parametrs such as BMI and smoking. Objective  To determine and calculate the incidence of allergic and non-allergic asthma in Latvia between different sexes and age groups. Methods  For development of research we used P. Stradins Clinical University Hospital Lung disease and thoracic surgery center diagnostic laboratory database. Database contained information about BP test results performed during the period of three years. Data was collected on 2417 patients who had undergone BP testing for pulmonary function measures, evaluation of the therapy efficiency or bronchial asthma diagnosis.  Results  Results of research shows that negative outcomes from BP testing is more often – 63%, than positive cases – 37%. Analyzing BP tests between the genders, we found that positive and negative test outcomes are common for both - women and men, but with the increase in age, the result of a positive test is dominated by women in the age group of 51-70 years (p=0,0307). The results of the positive BP test were summarized and grouped according to the BA form. Allergic asthma was detected in 8.9% cases, but the number of patients with non-allergic asthma was 3 times higher - 28.1%, from which we conclude that the predominant form of asthma is non-allergic asthma. The highest incidence of non-allergic (5,5%) asthma is observed in women aged 51 – 70. The number of cases of non-allergic asthma in women increases with age. Analyzing correlation between allergic and non-allergic asthma and BMI we found that increased BMI predominates in the non-allergic asthma and prevails mostly among women (p=0,00341). Increased bronchial reactivity and a positive BP test were statistically more common in smokers (p=0,00020). The predominant form of BA in smokers is non-allergic asthma. Conclusions  The obtained data show that non-allergic asthma predominates in adults. In women, unlike men, the incidence of non-allergic asthma increases with age, culminating in age 51-70. Increased BMI predominates in the non-allergic asthma and prevails mostly among women. Non-allergic asthma is more common in smokers than allergic asthma.",0

Phenotyping showed that most cells belonged to MSCs, expressing CD29, CD44 and SCA-1 surface markers above 90% on a population-level and partially expressing CD105. Adipodifferentiation showed a statistically significant difference between the control and SigmaR1 knock-out (SigmaR1 -/-) group using Oil-Red-O extraction method, thus it can be concluded that knock-out cells display weaker ability to differentiate towards adipocytes.",0

They are found in a variety of sources, such as fungus, bacteria and cereals. It is the structural differences between the various sources that relate to different pharmacological properties and biological activities.  All β – glucans are glucose polymers connected to a 1 → 3 linear β – glucosidic chain, however, the side chain bonds for each β – glucan are distinct and specific. Commonly used and well - known β – glucans from yeast and oat, are thought to have an anti – inflammatory properties and to activate immune cells in the organism. The aim of the study was to establish whether β – glucan from natural sources have an anti – inflammatory effect in LPS – stimulated THP-1 cells. To determine this, a cell viability test with a cell counting kit – 8 was performed and a NF-κB translocation in LPS inflammation model in THP-1 cells was analysed using a Guava EasyCyte 8HT flow cytometer.

People with SVD experience various symptoms, such as anxiety, restlessness, increased irritability, pain, gastrointestinal disorders, and cardiovascular disorders that cause constant anxiety and discomfort. These patients are excessively seeking medical help and consolation, but it is hard for them to accept non-pathological results in a medical examination. SVD is difficult to diagnose and requires the help of several specialists, as well as the person's own strength and contribution. If SVD is not properly diagnosed and the patient is not given appropriate help, it makes daily life very difficult. Nowadays, the pace of people's lives is very fast and busy, so the most accessible way to get help or advice about some health issues is a pharmacy. The aim of this bachelor’s paper is to find out the manifestations of somatoform autonomic dysfunction, its prevalence in society and the principles of treatment. A number of scientific publications and databases were analysed, as well as a randomised people survey to identify the distribution of SVD in society has been conducted.

Instantaneous nasal airflow measurements cannot reflect well on how patients feels during longer period of time. It is in our best interests to recognise nasal cycle as normal phenomenom and gain skill to differentiate it from pathological obstruction of nose. Long-term rhinoflowmetry is a good fit to follow more closely to the nasal cycle changes while user is being in relative comfort compared to alternatives. This method was combined with polysomnography thus allowing to pinpoint strong asociation between nasal cycle changes and body position changes and/or REM sleep.  The aim of this work is to characterize the nasal cycle at 24-hour intervals with a continuous method of measuring nasal air flows. The results of the study were obtained by measuring nasal air flow during 24 hours and combined with PSG accelleration sensosor data for body position gain. Only 7 measurments were valid for 24 hour and 8 for sleep time. During the work there were made the following conclusions: 1. Nasal cycle for all participants was observed.

No one knows the exact mechanism of the disease and it is uncurable. Taking into consideration how little people are informed about schizophrenia it creates prejudice and ignorance in people, often resulting in people with schizophrenia being rejected from society. Usually these fears are created because, we as a society do not know enough about the syndrome. Mostly, people with schizophrenia get treated with the pharmacological method, which effectively suppresses and treats schizophrenic symptoms. But, because most of the anti-psychotic drug side effects are sedation, people with schizophrenia struggle to do day to day activities and keep up any kind of energy.  The aim of this research was to evaluate awareness of Latvian residents and pharmacists about schizophrenia and therapeutic opportunities for people with schizophrenia in Latvia. To explain the results, not only literature was used but a survey was made, that 411 people filled out. The results indicate that Latvian citizens and pharmacists are mostly informed about the syndrome and its symptoms, and they want to see more information amongst the public about schizophrenia.",0

Previous research suggests there may be economic factors contributing to this. The primary objective of this study is to expand on the previous research by investigating the relationship between rates of mortality stratified by age groups; Perinatal, Neonatal, Infant, Under-five and Youth (5 - 14) the Baltic states; Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania with their corresponding macroeconomic indicators. By analysing a time period mindful of recent economic history, from 2008 to 2018, it allows us to see in detail the effects, if any, that the global financial crisis had on child mortality in the region.  Methods: Statistical data was gathered from national and international databases for rates of child mortality and macroeconomic Indicators. This data was then analysed using a multivariate regression analysis in SPSS.  Results: Statistically significant correlations were found between Total GDP and GDP per capita for under-five and youth (5 - 14) mortality for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Additionally, an association was found between Healthcare expenditure and Neonatal, Under-five and Youth mortality in Estonia, and Under-five mortality in Latvia. Moreover, an association was uncovered between rate of unemployment and the Under-five and Youth mortality mortalities in Lithuania. No further associations were found.  Conclusion: The mortality of children between the ages of 1 – 14 is tied to the economic stability of the Baltic states. Furthermore, Estonian health care spending policies are responsible, at least partially for the low levels of mortality recorded in Estonia. If similarly effective policies were to be applied, comparably low rates of child mortality could be achieved across the Baltics States.",0

For this reason, in the opinion of the author, it is important to analyze the most common types of vessel variations of the head and neck; the bifurcations of the common carotid artery, as well as three important branches of the external carotid artery, the superior thyroid a., the lingual a., and the facial a., including three-dimensional mapping of their anatomical variations. Aim of the work: To perform three-dimensional mapping of the common carotid bifurcations and the exterior carotid group branches relative to axial skeletal landmarks. Methods and materials: Computed tomography angiography of the brachiocephalic blood vessels of 28 patients was performed and the location of the carotid artery bifurcation and external carotid artery ventral group branches in relation to axial skeletal landmarks was determined. Results and conclusions: 1.The bifurcation of the carotid artery was on average 0.22 ± 9.23 (SD) mm above the upper terminal plate of the fourth cervical vertebra, 2.the superior thyroid a. branched on average 1.87 ± 4.36 mm above the common carotid artery bifurcation, but the left thyroid a. branched 1.61 ±3.12 mm  below the total bifurcation of the carotid artery. The right lingual a. branched an average of 13.77 ±8.01 mm but the left lingual a. averaged 13.63 ±7.90 mm above the bifurcation of the carotid artery, while the right facial a. branched an average of 20.00 ±7.59 mm, but the left facial a. averaged 21.52 ±8.24  mm above the carotid artery bifurcation. 3.Anatomical variation of the linguofacial trunk was observed in 14 patients (50%) (8 patients unilateral; 6 bilateral), while unilateral truncus thyrolinguofacialis was identified in one patient (0.03%).

Glucose and lactulose breath tests are generally accepted standard to diagnose SIBO. The North-American and European guidelines for breath testing set out different diagnostic approaches and lack guiding principles in several practical situations, i.e. no guidelines are provided as to how to interpret initially high H2 and CH4 concentrations. Aim: To find out mutual correlation of the results of glucose and lactulose breath tests by applying the diagnostic criteria set out in the North-American breath testing guidelines, to elaborate recommnedations to improve methodological approaches of breath testing.  Objectives: To analyse and systematize breath H2 and CH4 concentrations of participants involved in the study. To determine correlation between a positive test result and gastrointestinal symptoms reported during breath testing, and between gastrointestinal symptoms during breath testing and the gender.  Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of participants with abdominal symptoms who underwent breath testing in Digestive Disease Centre “Gastro” from 2015 till 2019 was performed.  Every participant underwent lactulose and glucose breath tests. The North-American criteria to define SIBO positive subjects were applied. Reported symptoms during the breath testing period were analysed. Results: The study cohort  was composed of 60 participants (50% male) with median age of 42 years. 41.7% (n=25) and 13.3% (n=8) of patients were diagnosed SIBO positive with lactulose and glucose test, respectively. 6.67% (n=4) tested positive with both breath tests. Correlation of negative testing results was 51.7% (n=31). 36.7% (n=22) demonstrated elevated (≥ 16 parts per million) initial H2 concentrations. High H2 concentrations were maintained in 45.5% (n=10) and 13.6% (n=3) in those with initially elevated concentrations in lactulose and glucose breath tests, respectively. CH4 producers accounted for 16.7% (n=10) of the cohort. 20% (n=12) reported symptoms during lactulose test and 28.3% (n=17) during glucose test. Bloating was the most common symptom reported in both breath tests. Statistically significant correlation between bloating and the positive result of a breath as well as between frequency of symptoms and the gender was not observed (p> 0.05). Conclusions: Differences exist between the glucose and the lactulose breath test results. In clinical practice doing both breath tests for each patient is recommended. Breath H2 and CH4 concentrations should be analysed. The study sets out recommendations to solve the problem of interpretation of initially elevated breath gases.",0

Association of rosacea with increased risk linked to other morbidities has been proven, being based on similar pathogenic mechanism of the ER stress. A broader insight of this has emerged only in the last decade. The metabolic syndrome is a complex of metabolic disturbances, including a set of cardiometabolic risk factors, and is known to be linked with higher risk acquiring other morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and insuline resistance is rapidly increasing. The possible connection of glycation and rosacea has never been researched and is analyzed for the first. The purpose of the research: Research the clinical manifastations of rosacea in patients with metabolic syndrome, insuline resistance and glycation.  Methods and materials:  Data of  “Veselības centrs 4” subsidiary “Dermatoloģijas klīnika” patients have been used in a prospective one center study. The data were obtained during the visit after the patient’s voluntary consent. All data were summerized using MS Excel, and IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 was used for the analysis of data. Results and conclusions: 1.The incidence of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance was significantly more frequent in rosacea patient group comparing to control group (Pχ = 1,56 x10-2, V = 0,38). 2.The severity of rosacea was not statistically significantly associated with metabolic syndrome (Pχ = 0,37) and insulin resistance (Pχ = 0,43). 3.Rosacea patient group was statistically significantly more likely to be overweight or obese (Pχ = 1,13 x10-4, V = 0,61), statistically significantly more likely to have increased waist circumference (Pχ = 5,26 x10-3, V = 0,42), and statistically significantly more likely to have arterial hypertension (Pχ = 1,24 x10-3, V = 0,46) than the control group.

By summarizing the data, it was recognized that the prevalence of dyslipidemia among patients with cirrhosis was high (from 35,2 to 77,8%). A moderately strong association was found in dyslipidemia characterized by reduced high-density lipoprotein levels (HDL). Patients with high BMI are more likely to have dyslipidemia with elevated cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein fraction.  The study did not confirm a statistically significant association between BMI and dyslipidemia in cirrhotic patients with DM (ρ=1,44 x10-2). However, data showed that patients with cirrhosis had a higher incidence (66.67%) of decreased serum HDL than patients without DM (23.08%). The association was close (V = 0.45).
