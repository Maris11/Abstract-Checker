High bat mortality rates have been observed in wind parks during the autumn migration of bats.,0
"During this migration, a large number of bats migrate along the shoreline of the Baltic sea.",0
"To reduce bat mortality rates as much as possible, it is necessary to establish high risk zones, in which constructing new wind parks can’t be allowed, and it is also important to be able to predict the intensity of the autumn bat migration using meteorological factors.",0
"During the time period from august 11th till august 25th in the University of Latvia Institute of Biology ornithology station in Pape, nightly bat passes were recorded in five different points with different distances from the sea.",0
"74,6 % of all bat passes were recorded during the three most active migration nights, and 46,3 % of all bat passes were recorded at the dunes.",0
Wind direction and speed had a significant impact on the bat migration.,0
The comperative method is often used to verify the hypothesis that mating strategy and behaviour depends on the species habitat.,0
In this method two taxonomically close species with different habitats are compared.,0
"The goal of this work is to inspect the differences in mating strategies of two Microtus hartingi subspecies, and its connection to subspecies formation in a fragmented area.",0
To measure the intensity of male care towards its offspring and female reproduction success in monogamous groups and polygynous groups with females who were relatives or unrelated with each other two M. hartingi subspecies were used: M. h. hartingi and M. h. lydius.,0
Experiments were carried out in a laboratory setting.,0
"To measure the reproduction success 70 groups with male and female, 70 groups with male and two related females, and 22 groups with male and two unrelated females were made.",0
To measure the male care of the litter 64 males were used: 32 M. h. hartingi and 32 M. h. lydius.,0
Results show that the most successful mating strategy for M. h. lydius is monogamy; there is no tendency to form communal groups.,0
"Males show high intensity of parental care, which is a characteristic of monogamous species.",0
Whereas M. h. hartingi reproduce successfully in monogamous and polygynous groups; there is a tendency to form communal groups.,0
The intensity of male parental care is lower than in M. h. lydius.,0
The tendency to form communal groups for M. h. hartingi is related to subspecies formation and existence in a fragmented area.,0
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction and restricted, repetitive behavior.",0
"The causes of autism are multifactorial, and its aetiology is complex, with both environment and genetic factors playing a significant influence.",0
"According to the CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) 2014 data, ASD prevalence is 1 in 59 children in the United States.",0
"The estimated prevalence of ASD in children in Latvia, similarly to Europe, is 1 in 100.",0
"Currently, according to the medicinal literature there is no one therapy for the treatment of ASD symptoms.",0
"However, there are studies showing that with dietary changes, usually in combination with nutritional supplements, some ASD symptoms can be significantly decreased.",0
"The most commonly used diet for ASD is gluten-free, casein-free diet (GF/CF).",0
"The objective of the study was to investigate whether a low carbohydrate diet (SCD, Specific carbohydrate diet /GAPS, Gut and Psychology Syndrome diet), complemented with vitamins/supplements (vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, vitamin C, ascorbyl palmitate), could improve gastrointestinal  health in children with ASD, as well as, reduce some typical ASD symptoms.",0
"SCD/GAPS diet suggests avoiding sugar, grains, starchy vegetables, non-fermented milk products and processed food.",0
"This was a prospective case-control three-month intervention study that involved 10 children with ASD, who followed SDC/GAPS diet and used the abovementioned vitamins/supplements, as well as 7 children with ASD, who did not change their diet and, and this smaller group was used as a control group.",0
Participants were 2 to 18 years old.,0
"The symptoms of children were evaluated 3 times during the study (in the beginning, middle, end of the study) using seven internationally validated questionnaires.",0
The validation of these questionnaires in Latvian was performed during this study.,0

"Master thesis title: Assessment of dietary habits, physical development and blood plasma biochemical parameters in junior school age children.",0
Background: Rapid increase of obesity in children and adolescents is alerting health problem.,0
"Regular measurements of weight and height, including body mass index (BMI) plotting on growth charts are important tools in monitoring children health and nutritional status.",0
Early detection and treatment is likely to reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic diseases.,0
"The aim of the study is to evaluate dietary habits, physical fitness and blood plasma biochemical parameters in junior school age children according to the parameters characterizing the physical development of children.",0
Materials and methods.,0
96 children (age 9-10 years) from 13 schools in Latvia were enrolled in the study.,0
Anthropometric data and blood pressure were measured with standard procedures.,0
Fitness level was determined by 3-minute step test.,0
In order to find out children nutritional habits food frequency questionnaire was used.,0
Children were divided into two groups: one group with overweight/obesity (N=32) and the second group with normal BMI/ underweight (N=64) based on World Health Organization BMI percentile scale.,0
Nutritional habits and fitness level were compared between both groups.,0
"Triglyceride, high density lipoprotein and glucose levels were determined by E. Gulbis clinical laboratory.",0
Estimated parameters using International Diabetes Federation criteria of metabolic syndrome in children were compared in both groups.,0
Results.,0
"There was a significant difference between the normal/underweight and overweight/obesity group in BMI, waist circumference, fitness level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose and triglyceride concentration.",0
Three participants in overweight/obesity group have two International Diabetes Federation criteria of metabolic syndrome.,0
"Only 57.3% of participants eat breakfast every day, 24% eat fruits and 35.4% vegetables every day.",0
In normal/underweight group participants eat more vegetables and drink more sweetened drinks.,0
Conclusions:,0
"The primary results of the study provide a comprehensive analysis of children's dietary habits, blood plasma biochemical parameters, fitness level and physical development.",0
The results suggest that children's dietary habits require significant adjustments to produce beneficial effects on children's physical development and regulation of blood plasma lipids and glucose homeostasis.,0
"Key words: dietary habits, physical development, blood plasma parameters, junior school age children.",0
Sugar is a part of our daily diet.,0
"People like it, and it is being consumed in many ways – by adding it to tea or coffee, in sugar sweetened beverages, or many other products where it is added during the manufacturing process and it would be hard to imagine about.",0
Sugar overconsumption is a general health problem of the population globally.,0
"The basis of concern about overconsumption of added sugars is excessive caloric load without any nutritional value, which leads to positive energy balance in diet.",0
"That may lead to progress of health problems like obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2.diabetes (WHO, 2015).",0
Young people are the group of population who do not care much about their dietary habits.,0
"Consumption of fruit, vegetable and wholegrain is less likely than sweets and sugar sweetened beverages (Vilaro et.al., 2018).",0
"Also, the data show that level of knowledge and understanding is weak about healthy diet and place of sugar in it.",0
"But – as the knowledge is higher, the level of interest is also growing and the consumption of sugar is lower.",0
The data obtained in our questionnaire show that understanding of added sugars is quite weak.,0
"Although, students are interested in their sugar consumption to maintain body weight or by health concerns, in most cases, added sugars are not recognized in the food labels.",0
"In about 50% of cases, sugar amount on the paper is not understood in real life.",0
"Anyway, students are interested in the topic and the idea of showing added sugars on the food label separately is evaluated positively as well as the use of mass media for educational purposes.",0
"Obesity is common risk factor for cardiovascular, metabolic and oncological diseases.",0
"Disease and obesity frequency is increasing, including children.",0
Therefore it is important to find ways to early diagnose potential risks and prevent them.,0
"Purpose of the work is to evaluate hs-CRO (found in the blood serum test) connection with participants anthropometric parameters, physical activity and dietary habits.",0
Methods.,0
"Participants of the study - 105 children (56.2% girls, 43.8% boys), age 9.5±0.5, average weight 35.1±9.1 kg, height 140.2±6.2 cm, waist circumference 60.7±8.0 cm.",0
"Blood serum was evaluated for hs-CRO, anthropometric parameters were measured, questionnaire about physical activity and nutrition habits, and physical activity test was completed.",0
Results.,0
Obesity was found in 30% of all participants.,0
Hs-CRO was importantly higher in group with obesity.,0
"Hs-CRO statistically correlated with BMI, waist circumference and fitness level.",0
"BMI correlated with waist circumference, in the same time waist circumference increased in overweight children and those with lower physical activity.",0
Relevance between dietary habits was not found.,0
Conclusions.,0
Hs-CRO is usable marker for cardiovascular diseases in children.,0
"In Latvia parvoviruses B19V, HBoV, hPARV4 are not sufficiently studied.",0
"There is some research that links encephalopathy and B19V, HBoV, hPARV4, although precise mechanisms of disease etiology are unknown.",0
Parvoviruses are small Parvoviridae family members that have singlestranded DNS that is 5-6 kilobases long.,0
"These viruses don’t have an envelope, but only a capsid.",0
"The aim of this study was to analyse B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 possible role in pathogenesis of unspecified encephalopathy.",0
"Blood and plasma DNA from 28 patients with unspecified encephalopathy were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences.",0
"6/28 (21,43%) patients were positive for B19V, 5/25 (20%) – for HBoV, none for hPARV4.",0
"DNA from blood and plasma samples of 7 patients with post-traumatic encephalopathy (control group) were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences.",0
"4/7 (57,14%) were positive for HBoV, B19V and hPARV4 was not detected.",0
"Blood and brain tissue (also temporal and frontal lobe) DNA from 56 post-mortem individs were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences.",0
"24/59 (43,86%) patients were positive for B19V, 3/24 (41,67%) – for HBoV, but 3/56 (5,36%) – for hPARV4.",0
"DNA from blood and brain tissue of 59 post-mortem individs without encephalopathy (control group) were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences.",0
"18/59 (30,51%) of patients were positive for B19V, 6/25 (24%) – for HBoV and 2/59 (3,39%) – for hPARV4.",0
To make general conclusion on involment of parvoviruses in the etiology/development of encephalopathy more analyses with increased sample size are needed.,0
"In this paper, HBcAg VLP packed RNA was analysed, depending on HBcAg expression plasmid used and their monomer or dimer form, chosen E. coli strains and cultivation medium.",0
12 different combinations of these parameters were analysed.,0
"Culture growth parameters (culture optical density and their specific HBcAg production) were examined, as well as VLP packed RNA fragment length and composition.",0
For three experiment variants NGS RNA sequencing data analysis was performed.,0
"Results show, that all 12 of variants differ in VLP packed RNA quantity and composition, but further research is needed to thoroughly establish packaging differences between experiment variants.",0
Several repetitions of experiment would also be helpful to prove regularity with good statistical significance.,0
The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and CCL5 involvement in AIT development.,0
"This study included 60 AIT patients, 30 autopsied subjects without thyroid pathologies and 30 healthy donors as controls.",0
HHV-6 genome sequence was detected in 59 (98%) AIT patients’ thyroid gland tissue and blood DNA samples and 23 (77%) in control group.,0
Active infection was detected in 35/59 (59%) AIT patients’ thyroid gland tissue.,0
Higher median viral load was found in patients with active viral infection than in patients with latent infection (median 1206 IQR: 455-2804 active and 544.5 IQR: 155-1589 copies/1x106 cells latent infection).,0
"AIT patients’ RANTES level was statistically lower (median 9.267, IQR: 3.489-16.93)  compared to blood donors (median 56.6, IQR: 30.71 - 101.5) AIT patients who were positive for HHV-6 U12 and/or U51 gene expression, showed much lower RANTES level, compared to patients with active viral infection without the expression of U12 and U51 genes.",0
"RANTES and HHV-6 (gp116) was visualised in AIT patients’ tissue and blood, as well as control groups blood samples with immunohistochemistry.",0
RANTES and was detected in control groups’ blood donor samples and AIT patient samples.,0
HHV-6 gB (gp116) expression was detected in AIT patients’,0
"PBMC samples, however RANTES expression was relatively low.",0
During this study construction of expression plasmids containing sequences of the N-terminal hemaglutinin (HA) tagged melanocortin type 2 (MC2R) and type 4 (MC4R) receptors with fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the C-terminus was performed.,0
The functional activity of these receptors was tested in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells and confirmed.,0
Goal of this thesis was to use these receptors to measure the effects of the HA tagand the GFP on receptor membrane turnover by carrying out enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging accordingly.,0
"Due to technical complications the effects of GFP was not determined, but observed effect of the HA tag diminishes the possibilty of it.",0
"Statistically signigicant effect of HA tag was measured as it increased the MC2R surface expression, while it did not affect membrane turnover of MC4R.",0
The stimulatory effect of the N-terminal HA tag exceeded the one of elevating the membrane turnover of MC2R associated protein (MRAP) in CHO cells.,0
"Tagging N-terminus with the HA peptide creates an artifact, because it abnormaly increases the membrane turnover of the MC2R, in this system it can not be used to characterise this parameter as in normal conditions.",0
Methods for measuring membrane turnover using epitope tags should be validated with different techniques.,0
"Gene therapy is a powerful method for treating various genetic diseases and DNA vaccine development, yet, lack of safe and efficient DNA delivery methods still remains the limiting obstacle to human gene therapy.",0
"Various synthetic gene delivery agents that are safer than recombinant viruses have been developed, however, they do not possess the required efficacy.",0
"Dendrimers are type of synthetic delivery vehicles that exhibit several advantages over other delivery agents, and these nanoparticles have been investigated over past few years for in vitro and in vivo genetic material delivery.",0
"In this study, four different dendrimers – generation four poly(amidoamine) dendrimer PAMAM G4, generation four cationic phosphorous dendrimer CPD G4, generation four cationic phosphorous dendrimer AE2 G4 and generation two cationic carbosilane dendrimer CBD-CS G2, were studied to characterize their ability to interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and form dendrimer-pDNA complexes.",0
"Furthermore, in vitro transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity experiments were performed.",0
"Also, the ability of two dendrimers – CPD G4 and CBD-CS G2 – to introduce DNA in vivo in murine animal model was examined using bioluminescence imaging.",0
The results of the biophysical characterization studies indicate that all four dendrimers efficiently bind pDNA and form stable complexes.,0
"Dendrimer CBD-CS G2 was the most efficient for cell transfection, and no significant cytotoxicity was observed.",0
In vivo bioluminescence studies showed that CBD-CS G2 dendrimer is not an efficient genetic material delivery vehicle.,0
"In contrast, mice treated with pDNA complexed to increasing concentration of CPD G4 dendrimer, displayed bioluminescence in concentration dependent manner, and the highest photon flux was obtained in mice treated with 50 µg of CPD G4.",0
"These results indicate that phosphorous dendrimer CPD G4 is the most suitable one of the four investigated dendrimers for in vivo gene delivery, however, increase of transfection efficacy requires further optimization of DNA-dendrimer formulations.",0
"The yeasts are capable to synthesize aromatic compounds, therefore fermentation by yeast is an alternative method for the production of natural 2-phenylethanol.",0
The aim of this work was to investigate the use of yeast Kluyveromyces lactis in the biosynthesis of 2-phenylethanol in lactose containing medium.,0
"We determined the most suitable K. lactis strain for 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis, investigated the effect of medium composition on 2-PE production, dinamics of 2-PE synthesis during fermentation, K. lactis DSM 70799 2-phenylethanol tolerance, and two-phase extractive fermentation with rapeseed oil was performed.",0
In this work three industrially used K. lactis strains were used.,0
From these strains K. lactis DSM 70799 produced the highest 2-phenylethanol concentration.,0
"The higher 2-PE concentration was obtained in lactose medium, therefore, as a substrate for the production of 2-phenylethanol, can be used lactose containing cheese whey and milk permeate.",0
"Phenylethanol is toxic to yeasts and inhibition of cell growth begins by adding 2,04 g/L of 2-PE.",0
"To reduce the toxicity and increase the amount of produced 2-PE, two-phase extractive fermentation with the addition of oil can be performed.",0
"Methods mastered during the research: yeast cultivation methods, two-phase fermentation, biomass determination with spectrophotometer and multimode micro plate reader – incubator, determination of 2-PE with HPLC chromatograph and enzymatic determination of sugars.",0
"One of the cardio-metabolic diseases risk factors is weight, which is connected with high levels of fat mass, especially in abdominal region.",0
Beside the anthropometry methods for cheaper and easier unhealthy metabolic weight diagnosis there is bioelectric impedance analysis methods popular.,0
"However, the preciseness of these methods is still debatable.",0
Therefore the task was to evaluate the validity of the abdominal fat tissue bioimpidence analysis method in comparison to anthropometry methods.,0
Total number of participants in research was 78 (48 women; 30 men).,0
"To determine participants parameters for body tissue composition such methods as anthropometry and bioimpidence were used which entail: waist circumference, sagital abdominal diameter, total relative fat mass, abdominal and visceral fat level.",0
"In research it was concluded what it is necessary to use as many risk indicators as possible as well as their combinations when evaluating the health risks associated with obesity, as inclusion of one or more indicators in the assessment may lead to a misleading picture of the health risk.",0
In this paper the information on the abilities of plant hyperaccumulation is summarized.,0
"The aim was to examine the possibility to use tallest stonecrop in research of heavy metal influence and uptake in controlled conditions and experimentally determine the accumulation of biogenic metals, - copper, zinc, manganese and sodium in plants, which were grown in the presence of different metal concentrations.",0
"To check the physiological reaction, chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured, in the end metal content in differerent parts of plants was determined.",0
"The results showed that the tallest stonecrop is able to effectively accumulate manganese and zinc in shoots, big amount of manganese was accumulated.",0
"Copper and sodium were accumulated too, but the plants’ growth and development was inhibited at the higher concentrations of sodium.",0
"Chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence in leaves also was influenced, but the plants were able to adapt.",0
Tallest stonecrop is the potential candidate in phytoremediation.,0
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a structure associated with viral infections and it is involved in the modification of immune response.,0
"Larifan is a bacteriophage derived heterogenous dsRNA that is produced in Latvia, however poly(I:C) is a synthetic dsRNA.",0
"The aim of the master thesis was to compare the effect of poly(I:C), Larifan and dsRNA of different lenght effect on lymphocyte subpopulations, dendritic cell maturation and the produced cytokines and chemokines.",0
"Using flow cytometry, dsRNA effect on lymphocyte subpopulation markers were described and with Luminex xMAP analysis biologically active molecule prodoction were analyzed.",0

"Fires are natural boreal forest ecology disturbances that change different forest ecosystem parameters and biological diversity, and in Natura 2000 site “Ādaži” that kind of disturbance is imitated using prescribed burning.",0
In this research groundcover restoration after prescribed burning and fires was studied in dry scots pine forests of Ādaži by establishing plots and assessing species projective covers using Braun-Blanquet method.,0
"Species composition changes after prescribed burning and fire are similar, because in both cases after burning number of species increased which is explained by introduction of pioneer species which/whom dispersal mainly was by seeds.",0
Most of species projective covers decreased after fires and that made open substrate and suitable conditions for sun-loving plants.,0
Year after fires ground lichens disappeared and three years after fire they still haven’t regenerated.,0
"Bilberry is a dwarf shrub that is one of the most abundant species on ground vegetation in boreal forest ecosystems, however it is not enough valuated.",0
It has a positive impact on species biological diversity and its presence is one of the indicators for enrichment in growing conditions (Bryant 1983).,0
"Similar to trees bilberry annual rings provide information about conditions in specific territory, nevertheless about shorter period of time (Schwingruber, Poschold 2005).",0
Slitere national park and its surrounding was chosen as a study area because of the various aged Vacciniosa stands found in this territory.,0
Also because of the forest fire which affected part of its territory.,0
In total 21 plots (10 x 10 m) were made.,0
"Six of them were established in Vacciniosa young stands (13 – 21 years old), the rest of them were established in Vacciniosa stands with age ranging from 42 to 257 years.",0
In each of the sampling plots five subplots were made based on specific scheme.,0
In each subplot vegetation cover (%) and specie composition was determined.,0
Diagonally three bilberry ramet samples were collected.,0
"Samples were processed in laboratory, measured the diameter, height and determined the age.",0
DCA ordination analysis was used to determine differences in vegetation between sites.,0
"Generalized mixed linear model was made, to determine forest age influence on bilberry ramet parameters.",0
This study finds that vegetation between different aged Vacciniosa stands do not differ.,0
Whereas bilberry cover (%) differs and has a positive correlation with the stand age.,0
"Likewise forest stand age positively affects bilberry ramet parameters – diameter, height, age.",0
Yet increased forest stand age decrease presence possibility of three to five year old bilberry ramets which have the most intensive formation of new clones.,0
"In young stands vegetation groups into two parts, respectively vegetation in burned and unburned stands.",0
Significant differences in bilberry cover between both stand types were not observed.,0
Master's,0
"Thesis was established in University of Latvia, Faculty of Biology, at the department of Botany and Ecology and in Latvian State Forest Research Institute “Silava” from May 2016 till May 2018.",0
"The aim of the research was testing a novel approach to find leading species in bird social groups – species, whose generated acoustic information (mobbing calls) are actively used by other participants of the group.",0
The acoustic mobbing call recording and playback methods were used.,0
Responses of members of wintering mixed-species bird flocks to the willow tit Poecile montanus and the crested tit Lophophanes cristatus mobbing calls were analyzed and discussed.,0
"Willow tits, crested tits, coal tits and nuthatches attended playbacks of mobbing calls.",0
The results of this study show that the majority of the participants attended playbacks by willow tits.,0
This suggests willow tit as the leadering species in the bird mixed-species groups.,0
Resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy compounds is a significant problem in cancer treatment resulting in tumor regeneration and relapse.,0
"Chemoresistance can be mediated by various cell mechanisms, of which ATP binding casette (ABC) transporter overexpression is the most studied.",0
Resistance often is mediated by selection of chemotherapy resistant subpopulations.,0
Cancer stem cells (CSC) have the ability to avoid chemotherapy effects and to renew tumor cell population.,0
The aim of this study was to determine ABC family gene expression and CSC characteristics in a doxorubicin resistant subpopulation of triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.,0
After pulsed treatment with doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells higher ABC transporter gene transcriptomic expression of most ABC family genes tested both after exposure and the following passage was determined.,0
"Overexpression of several CSC marker genes was found, and also other CSC characteristics were identified – ability to renew cell population and higher colony formation ability.",0
"The restored population had higher resistance to doxorubicin, compared to control culture.",0
"Based on previously published research revealing the inner lighting significance on hole-nester occupancy in artificial nestboxes, a presumption was carried out, that the specimens of targeted species will choose brighter nestboxes over the darker ones.",0
The target of the study was to reveal the role of artificial nestbox inner lighting level on the nest-site choice of Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca and Great Tit Parus major.,0
"In nature reserve “Garkalnes meži,” 152 nestboxes in 4 sample plots were prepared for the experiment by painting inner-hind walls of the nestboxes white, black and left unpainted (treatment).",0
"During the nesting season, nestbox occupation and internal lighting data were collected.",0
"In total, 32 Ficedula hypoleuca and 8 Parus major occupied nestboxes were observed.",0
"After carrying out dispersion and linear regression model analysis, the colour of inner-hind wall and level of internal lighting were determined as influential factors on nestbox occupation and nesting attempts.",0
"Results revealed that by the level of inner lighting nestboxes with white inner-hind walls are the brightest ones, black ones are the darkest and the unpainted (treatment) nestboxes are positioned in between.",0
It was found out that the effect of nestbox defects on nestbox occupation is of negative statistical insignificance.,0
"Due to inssuficient amount of data it was not possible to determine nest-choice trends for Great Tits, for Pied Flycatchers a prefered choice of nestboxes with higher level of internal lighting was confirmed.",0
"Except in unpainted (treatment) group, occupation of nestboxes tends to increase along with increasing level of inner lighting.",0
It was found out that occupation of nestboxes is insignificantly negative affected by nestbox defects.,0
Death from breast cancer is usually associated with primary tumor’s ability to produce metastasis in other organs.,0
"For that, the cancer cells must be able to migrate and invade.",0
Studies about extracellular Ca2+ concentration effect on breast cancer cell ability to migrate and invade are incosistent.,0
The aim of the research was to determine the extracellular Ca2+ concentration effect on MCF-7 migration and invasion abilities.,0
MCF-7 cancer cell line was cultivated in media with different Ca2+ concentrations.,0
"It was concluded that increased extracellular Ca2+ concentration decreases populations ability to migrate and invade, but does not affect its PDT.",0
An increased expression of tight junction genee CLDN3 was observed in cells cultivated in Ca2+ concentration.,0
The work was done RSU Laboratory of the Molecular Genetics from November 2017 till May 2018.,0

In recent years the environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals has been increasing rapidly.,0
This attracts the attention of researchers since these potentially bioactive compounds may significantly affect water quality and hydroecosystems as well as human health.,0
"Objective of the study is to determine toxicity of ibuprofen, acetaminophen (paracetamol), diclofenac, amoxicillin, ipidacrine hydrochloride, chloropyramine hydrochloride and sulpiride containing products using two biotesting methods: Daphnia magna acute toxicity test and algae growth inhibition test.",0
During the work data on the inhibitory effect of pharmaceutical substances on aquatic organisms has been obtained.,0
Sublethal concentrations – LC50 (concentrations that cause 50% death of test organisms) and effective medial concentration – EC50 (concentrations that cause 50% decline in physiological function of testorganisms) were found as well as sensitivity of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms were compared.,0
Experiment results show that commonly used products have medium to high toxicity.,0
"Pharmaceutical products which contain sulpiride (antidepressant), ipidacrine hydrochloride (NS stimulator) and chloropyramine hydrochloride (anti-allergic agent) have very high toxicity.",0
Pharmaceuticals that enter water bodies may cause both crustacean and algae death especially in wastewater discharge spots of pharmaceutical factories.,0
"Chalk mold is real problem in production of bread, it cause early deterioration and loss – in to flesh are appearing white powdery of inclusions.",0
"The reason is flour, that contain yeast and molds.",0
The raw meterials used for bread production contains nutrients that have a favourable environment for the development of microorganisms.,0
"Undesirable microorganisms on the bread can be get of the air, equipment, containers, transport and personnel.",0
"This research was made in order to clarify if in bread bakery SIA “xxx” is occuring chalk mould disease and microorganisms whouse are able to cause it, therefore were obtained samples from moust typical raw materials and locations.",0

Air samples were collected from 42 storage rooms.,0
90 exhibits of collections were tested.,0
Samples were collected from three Riga museums and their storages.,0
Conducted samples were seeded on agar media and cultivated at 24oC for 10-12 days to create fungal colonies that would later be identified.,0
"In the air, fungal contamination was elevated during the spring period.",0
"In storage rooms of  the Riga museums dominated fungal genera Penicillium, Aspergillus and Cladosporium.",0
"In collections' exhibits, the most fungi was found in textiles.",0
Resistance to antibiotics is a global problem that has caused concerns for possible treatment of bacterial infections.,0
Colistin is a broad spectrum antibiotic that is used to treat multiresistant bacteria.,0
Resistance to colsitin is obtained by mcr genes that can be located in plasmids or chromosomes.,0
In this study colistin resistence was determined in food and swine caecum samples.,0
Samples were obtained from food products and swine caecum in VPP (National Research programm) “AgroBioRes” project No. 5 “Resistance of microorganisms and other biological and chemical risks research procedures development and application in the food chain” at 2015.,0
and 2017.,0
In total 354 Escherichia coli isolates were characterized.,0
"With minimum inhibitory concentration method 16 samples were shown to be colistin resistant, however 18 samples were found positive for mcr-1 gene.",0
"By performing next generation sequencing (NGS) it was found, that in all mcr-1 gene isolates one type of insertion sequence and IncX4 plasmid was present, that could be related to mcr gene transfer between bacteria.",0
"With pulsed field gel electrophoresis and NGS data, genetic relatedness between food isolates and swine cloacal samples was shown.",0
"Faba bean (Vicia faba) is widely grown crop used in food, livestock feed and agronomu.",0
Fertilizers used to increase yield may affect not only crops but also soil microbiota.,0
This paper examines how fertilizers influence soil microbiota by evaluating changes in their amount and faba bean crops growth and yeald.,0
Obtained results show that amount of fungi in soil is dependant of fertilizer type.,0
"In contrast, no significant effect from fertilizers has been observed on amount of soil bacteria.",0
"Fertilizers play important role on development and crops yeald of faba bean, but these parameters are also affected by potassium and phosphorus content in soil.",0
Water is a natural resource that is essential for many life processes in the human body.,0
Contaminated water is responsible for many human diseases that lead to severe consequences for the affected individual.,0
It is very important to set and fulfill quality standards for both tap and bottled water.,0
In this research we assessed the bacteriological quality for commercially available natural mineral water.,0
The samples were incubated on R2A agar for 240 hours and the results compared to standards set in normative acts.,0
Our results were considerably higher than the values set in the law.,0
"We determined that these samples contained bacteria with both innate and acquired resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline, but the amounts of resistant bacteria were considerably lower than treated Riga tap water.",0
"The identified bacteria from the water samples were a part of the natural water microbiota, and we did not find any pathogens or coliforms.",0
Proteasomal gene polymorphisms have been previously implicated in autoimmune disease.,0
"In order to evaluate potential biomarkers for multiple sclerosis (MS), 280 diagnosed MS patients were genotyped for several PSMA6 and PSMC6 proteasomal gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).",0
The obtained data were compared with data from 305 controls to investigate the possible association between these polymorphisms and MS.,0
Further analysis including data available on PSMA3 SNP genotypes revealed two multi-locus genotypes and three haplotypes of potential clinical significance.,0
Several investigated SNPs had noticeable allele-dependent alternate DNA secondary structures.,0
Minor alleles of the PSMA6 rs1048990 SNP were found to have a borderline significant difference in distribution between responders and non-responders to interferon-beta therapy.,0
In this study the characteristics of the one-year vegetative and generative stems of labrador marsh tea Rhododendron tomentosum Harmaja are decribed.,0
Compare the apical and basal end fragments of each stem.,0
Stems are gathered in three different stands to find out the environmental factors - the possible impact of climatic conditions and soil composition on Rh. tomentosum primary and secondary growth.,0
"For stems was measured annual growth, but for cuttings measured eight characteristic values.",0
"Stems were longer, radially larger growing in acidic soil and moderate meteorological  conditions in Apšuciems marsh.",0
"Smaller sizes were typical of the samples collected in the Teiči marsh , according to meteorological observations previous year were richer in rainfalls and flooding affected on nutrient intake and growth.",0
"Generic shoots are longer than vegetative shoots and larger in diameter, because flower crown are based on them and that requires more mechanical strength and better availability for pollinators.",0
"The sections from apical part fragments are characterized by a relatively large primary bark, lot of glands and new buds, while the sections from basal part fragments already have a fairly larger secondary layer of wood.",0
The Whooper Swan is a speicies of swan that nests in the territory of Latvia and is commonly found in a wide range of habitats mostly in Europe and Northern regions of Eurasia.,0
In this Bachelor’s thesis a selection of on retrotransposons based primers was carried out to determine the genetic diversity of the Whooper Swan species.,0
The Whooper Swan samples used in this Bachelor’s thesis were collected in the geographical region of Kurzeme.,0
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis.,0
For the selected primer 2075 there were found 31 loci with 28 polymorphic loci (90.32 %).,0
The genetic semblance of the 21 included nests was higher than 77%.,0
"During analysis the highest count of polymorphic loci was found in nest No. 1 with 16 polymorphic loci (51,6%).",0
All procured data was mathematically analysed using POPGENE and NETSYS programs.,0
Broad-leaved tree forests of Latvia are very fragmented and cover a small forest area.,0
"They are associated with a unique flora containing many protected species, and therefore their protection is urgent.",0
"Because of ecological succession, tree canopy composition changes, which can improve or degrade the typical vegetation, for example if spruce is found in understory.",0
"The study aim was to determine age structure of overstory and understory tree species in randomly selected broad-leaved forest stands, to predict the main successional direction of change.",0
The objective was to determine age structure of trees in stands in Latvia.,0
In randomly selected stands 50x20 m big plots were established.,0
Height and diameter were measured for trees with diameter at breast height > 10cm.,0
Species in the overstory was identified.,0
In all plots together 17 tree species were found.,0
"Oak was found in 47 plots, spruce in 44.",0
"Oak was the oldest tree species, in some plots it was older than 400 years.",0
"In understory eith height >10 m only few tree species were found – Picea abies, Tilia cordata, Fraxinus excelsior.",0
This indicates regeneration of some broad- leaved tree species are able to regenerate.,0
"The aim of the Master thesis is to assay expressed and purified with eGFP and PADRE T-cell epitope conjugated ApMV and CMV CP N-terminal domain oligomerization properties and immunogenicity in mice, comparing data with the virus-like particle immunogenicity.",0
These results could be used in further experiments to assay immunologically important epitope.,0
"Master thesis was developed from September 2016 till May 2018 at the Plant Virology group at Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, under supervision of Dr. biol.",0
Andris Zeltiņš and Dr. biol.,0
Ina Baļķe.,0
"During the work process, in addition to during Bachelor thesis developed constructs, two more constructs were made, where in addition to eGFP model protein and His-tag, CP N-terminal ends were genetically conjugated with PADRE T-cell epitope.",0
Conjugated proteins were expressed and purified using affine chromatography.,0
"During the protein purification, as well as during electrophoretic mobility shift assay, dynamic light scattering, mass-spectrometry and electron microscopy assays, nCMV proteins showed to form oligomers when incubated with RNA, PADRE T-cell epitope makes constructs non-stable, nApCP proteins show the strong proteolysis and can not further be used.",0
"Immunization experiments demonstrated, that every additional immunostimulating component raises immune response of immunotag.",0
In vitro culture initiation and shoot rejuvenation from birches in their reproductive phase are difficult and often unsuccessful.,0
"To date, neither physiological nor molecular markers have been developed to evaluate the degree of juvenility of birch in vitro shoots, which could be used to track rejuvenation process and to determine factors affecting it.",0
The study was carried out with the aim of finding out factors affecting in vitro rejuvenation of silver brich in vitro shoots and to develope physiological and molecular juvenility markers for birch in vitro shoots.,0
"The effect of subculture time, nitrogen amd sucrose concentration and different plant growth regulators on stabilized birch in vitro shoot rejuvenation were determined, using morphological, anatomical, physiological parameters as well as expression analysis of micro RNA (miRNA) 156 and their target genes was done.",0
In addition effect of auxins and cytokinins on newly initiated birch in vitro shoots were detrmined,0
"It was shown, that suboptimal subculture time, increased nitrogen and sucrose level and increased auxin and cytokinin concentration promotes maturation of stabilized birch in vitro shoots, which is indicated by low morphogenic potential, elevated phloem width ratio to stem radius, developed periderm, increased polyphenoloxidase activity, as well as reduced level of miR156_511 and increased level of SPL1 expression.",0
"WPM, zeatin 0,5 mg L-1 medium and 30 day subculture time are the most optimal conditions for rejuvenation.",0
"MiR156 and its target genes SPL1 and SPL9 can be used as molecular birch juvenility markers, from which the greatest differences in expression levels between juvenile and mature birches are observed in miR156_511 and its target gene SPL1.",0
"Physiological juvenility markers, that correspond with molecular markers are high morphogenic potential, reduced phloem width ratio to stem radius, low polyphenoloxidase activity as well as undeveloped periderm.",0
The aim of this research was to analyse spruce stump surface coverage with ‘Rotstop’ preparation and to examine impact of different concentration of P. gigantea preparations on development of fungi in conifer wood.,0
Stump surface coverage is important to spruce stump treatment with P. gigantea.,0
We investigated stump surface coverage with preparation and P. gigantea development depending on different diameter of holes in harvester guide bars.,0
Stump treatment was made by four guide bars with different diameter holes drilled in it.,0
Holes in the fifth guide bar were made by standard manufacturer.,0
After a year samples were collected and analysed.,0
There were no significant differences in area occupied by P. gigantea between treatments.,0
P. gigantea development in spruce wood was low.,0
Frequency of P. gigantea colonized stumps increased with increasing stump diameter.,0
Treatments with manufacturer’s recommended P. gigantea spore suspension concentration (5000 spores in mL-1) and reduced concentration (2500 and 1250 spores in mL 1) was applied in spruce and pine billets to evaluate reduced concentration effect on P. gigantea development and efficiency against Heterobasidion spp.,0
Treatments in this study were carried out using local isolates of P. gigantea PG 323 and PG 286.,0
In spruce wood treatments with twice reduced spore concentration were no significantly different from recommended concentration.,0
Treatment with 1250 spores in mL-1 failed to control infection.,0
In pine wood there was no significant decrease in efficiency in any of the treatments.,0
In spruce wood isolate PG 323 was more effective .,0
"Women menstrual cycle influence physiological changes in organism organ system work and functions, for example, circulation, metabolism, thermoregulation.",0
Scientific data about metabolic rate and it’s variation dynamics is inconsistent.,0
That’s the reason why as a purpose for this study was to determine variation of metabolism and it’s parameters during menstrual cycle in young adult women.,0
"In current study were participated 8 joung, clinically healthy woman in age from 20 to 34, with indirect calorimetry were determined gas changes data, which were used to determine resting metabolic rate and energy substrate - carbohydrates and lipids, oxidation rate during menstrual cycle.",0
"The results demonstrate that variations in resting metabolic rate during menstrual cycle in young adult women variates from 6% to 19%, the maximal resting metabolic rate is during menstrual cycle luteal phase.",0
Individual variation value is independent from resting metabolic rate absolute value.,0
Dinamics ir energy substrate oxidation variates from 26% to 131% for lipids and from 23% to 65% for carbohydrates.,0
"Maximal lipid oxidation is shortlu afret ovulacion at early luteal phase, maximal carbohydrate oxidation is while ovulation and also at late luteal phase.",0
"Obtained data let to conclude, that metabolic parameter variation value is individual, and it is independent from persons anthropometric and body mass parameters, or from individual metabolic absolute rate and energetic substrate oxidation rate.",0
"Nowadays, high-quality water resources are becoming increasingly unavailable.",0
Groundwater is one of the main sources of drinking water and it is important to monitor its quality.,0
Composition of microorganisms was investigated in the groundwaters of the Middle Latvia lowland.,0
"Samples were obtained from four Skaistkalne drillholes, four fountainheads (Barbele, Beipartu, Iecava, Serene) and Iecava river.",0
"Samples were applied to agarized media, number of bacterial colony forming units/ml was determined, bacterial cultures were isolated and identified with the BBL Crystal ™ identification system.",0
From the samples of groundwater 16 species of bacteria and 3 species of fungi were identified.,0
Five of the species belong to risk group 2 pathogenic bacteria.,0
"The chemical and microbiological data of the samples were compared with the regulations of the drinking water, which fully corresponded to Skaistkalne No.1 water drillhole.",0
"Apple is a commercially important horticultural crop around the world, but every year important losses are made by apple scab caused by fungal pathogen Venturia inaequalis.",0
"Apple scab management is mostly based on intense and regular use of pesticides, resulting with negative environmental impacts and negative impacts of human health.",0
An alternative is to create scab resistant apple trees cultivars.,0
It has already been observed that monogenic resistance to apple scab is not durable and it could be improved by including multiple resistance genes in one plant genotype or making gene pyramiding.,0
The aim of the study was to evaluate and characterize Malus domestica (Malus × domestica) resistance against apple scab (causal agent Venturia inaequalis) heredity and the effectiveness of the selection process in hybrid families with different parental resistance.,0
"For this purpose, samples of 862 apple hybrids has been analyzed.",0
"Samples are divided into populations, depending on the resistance genes (Rvi6 and Rvi5) occurred in the parent genotype and their combinations (Rvi6 × susceptible variety; Rvi6 × Rvi6 and Rvi5 × Rvi5).",0
Field scoring has been performed in 2016 and 2017.,0
"Scorings are made using the international VINQUEST apple scab assessment methodology, but the genes were identified by using specific and SSR markers.",0
In parent genotyping 22 SSR molecular markers has been used.,0
"There are only few studies that includes combined analyze of molecular and apple scab field resistance scoring data, although they can give more realistic pattern of resistance selection process.",0
"The study showed that the resistance of the apple scab in field is affected not only by resistance genes in genotype, but also the origin of apple cultivar, tree health status and resistance to other diseases.",0
"Apple scab resistance is determined by genetic factors, but the environment also has a modifying effect.",0
"The assessment of the heredity for resistance genes included in the breeding, it was found that the resistance genes Rvi6 (Vf) and Rvi5 (Vm) are inherited in accordance with Mendel's laws.",0
The pyramiding of both genes in progeny discovered their separate inheritance.,0
"In general, the inheritance of both genes in progeny was not a main determining factor of apple field resistance tree, because the field's resistance to apple scab is influenced by a combination of several factors.",0
"Organic production is becoming more and more popular, when organic fertilizers are used for plant nutrition.",0
One of advantages of organic fertilizers is rather high concentration of plant nutrients.,0
"However, there is a lack of knowledge on their influence on the growth, development and photosynthesis of different leafy vegetables and herbs.",0
The aim of the investigation was to evaluate the influence of different concentration of vermicompost and compost on the yield and quality of leafy vegetables and herbs.,0
"Experiments were established at the premises of the Cathedra of Plant Physiology of the Faculty of Biology of Latvia University in the period from March 2017 to December 2017, where experiments on ten different leafy vegetables and herb species were conducted: rocket salad, basil, peppermint, spearmint, dragonhead, thyme, marjoram, rosemary, and valerian.",0
Plants were grown in the pots where peat substrate or soil taken from organic field were used as substrate supplemented with different percentage per volume of compost or vermicompost.,0
The measurement on plant morphological parameters were performed at the end of experiment to evaluate the influence of fertilization material and concentration on the plant development and growth.,0
Electrical conductivity of substrate was measures at the beginning of growing season and harvest of plants.,0
Starting with the 3rd week after plant transplanting in the growing substrate chlorophyll concentration and fluorescence of chlorophyll-α were measured.,0
Dried plant samples were used for determination of ion concentration and electric conductivity.,0
The aboveground mass of plants increases significantly in higher dosage of fertilization materials.,0
Some species expressed sensitivity to increased fertilization rates with reduction of yield in comparison to control.,0
It was found that vermicompost had better influence on the plant growth in comparison to compost.,0
"Also, chlorophyll formation in the plants was promoted in the variant with vermicompost fertilization.",0
"Fluorescence parameter Performance Index and Fv/Fo relative changes during the vegetation period varied between plant species, also depend of fertilization material and concentration.",0
Ion concentration in the leaves increased by increasing fertilization dosage.,0
Recommended fertilization dosage is 20 – 30 % of substrate volume.,0
"Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging problem worldwide and also in Latvia, in recent years gaining more and more attention.",0
There is increasing number of clinical reports due to nosocomial infections caused by drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteria.,0
The aim of present study was to search the prevalence of Expended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae family strains in human gut microflora.,0
"The results indicate that 45 (33,09%) of 136 inpatients from RAKUS ""Biķernieki” hospital were ESBL positive carriers on discharge from clinic.",0
"blaCTX-M was the predominant resistance determining gene in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, as detected by PCR.",0
"In addition, the virulence determining pks gene was detected.",0
The results indicate very low prevalence of pks gene (in one of 39 DNA isolates).,0
"Keywords: Enterobacteriaceae, ESBL, pks gene, carriage in gut.",0
Organoclay is a material with antimicrobial properties and it has the potential to be used for protection against wood degrading fungi.,0
This study examines the effect of two types of organoclay that contain trimethyloctadecylammonium chloride on Coniophora puteana and Trametes versicolor.,0
"Furthermore, the effectiveness to provide protection to birch plywood against wood-decay fungi with an organoclay additive in phenol-formaldehyde resin glue and impregnation film was also evaluated.",0
The red organoclay had better inhibitory properties against wood-decay fungi than the white organoclay when added to a malt extract-agar medium.,0
"Based on the data from standards NF B 51-295 (bending strength test) and LVS ENV 12038:2002 (mass loss test), our results show that experimentally laminated plywood is more durable against wood-decay fungi than experimentally laminated plywood with an organoclay additive.",0
It has been found that C. puteana degrades plywood more efficiently than T. versicolor.,0
None of the four tested types of plywood was fully resistant against decay fungi due to their mass loss being greater than 3 %.,0
"Comparing samples with two different sizes for each of the standards, it was found that sample size affects the results.",0
"In conclusion, the results show that the organoclay additive in phenol-formaldehyde resin glue and impregnation film does not provide effective protection for birch plywood against white and brown rot fungi.",0
"Sea holly (Eryngium maritimum L.) and sea aster (Aster tripolium L.) are rare and endangered species, which are listed which is listed in Red Data Book of Latvia in the 1st category.",0
"Both species are remarkable for valuable natural substances with potential for use in pharmacology, cosmetics and the food industry.",0
The aim of the work was to investigate the effects of different concentrations of sucrose and nitrate in the plant tissue culture medium on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in sea holly and sea aster.,0
The hypothesis was that reduced nitrate concentration and increased sucrose concentration in the medium increase total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of extracts in shoot cultures.,0
In the beginning  juvenile and homogeneous shoots were obtained by propagating them in media with 2.22 μM 6-benzylaminopurine for one month and after that cultivating them in MS medium without any hormonal supplements.,0
"Three concentrations of sucrose (40, 20and 10 g L-1) and three concentrations of MS salts containing nitrogen (25%; 50% and 75%) were used.",0
Murashige and Skoog medium nitrogen containing salts were NH4NO3 and KNO3.,0
Sea holly shoot cultures were cultivated for one to two months and sea aster shoot cultures were cultivated 2 months.,0
"After the period of cultivation, measurements were carried out to determine the content of the fresh weight, dry weight and chlorophyll content.",0
Total phenolic content as gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per mg g-1 dry weight and the antioxidant activity expressed as Trolox equivalent in μM mg-1 of the dry weight were determined by spectrophotometry method.,0
"Reduced levels of MS nitrogen-containing salts and high, normal or reduced sucrose concentrations had no significant effect on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in both plant species.",0
Sea aster had a slight tendency for higher  total phenolic content in media with 75% MS nitrate content but the difference was not statctically significant.,0
Total phenolic content of sea holly shoots ranged from 16.03±1.69 to 18.14±1.10 mg g-1 GAE and the antioxidant content from 1517.0±63.84 to 1592±18.64 μM mg-1,0
Trolox equivalent but in sea aster shoots total phenolic content ranged from to 13.06±1.82 to 18.62±0.73 mg g-1 GAE and antioxidant content ranged from 1349±52.95 to 1471±88.96 μM mg-1 Trolox equivalent.,0
"Different concentratons of sucrose and nitrates had a significant effect on increase of fresh weight, the proportion of water in shoots and chlorophyll content of sea holly shoots, .",0
These factors also had a significant effect on the content of chlorophyll in shoot leaves and water proportion in sea aster shoots.,0
"Even though sawyer beetles of Monochamus genus were considered as secondary pests before, their significance in Europe has increased after introduction of pine wood nematode Bursaphelencus xylophilus in Portugal in 1999, as this species vectors.",0
"B. xylophilus causes pine wilt disease, which kills large amount of trees.",0
"There is no data about occurrence of Monochamus genus and effectivity of pheromone traps in Latvia, which is an important information if there is a need to control B. xylophilus in future in risk zones – territories with higher chance of introduction of pests.",0
The aim of this work is to find out occurrence of sawyer beetles of Monochamus genus in risk zones in Latvia and to evaluate effectivity of pheromone traps for catching conifer saproxylic beetles.,0
The research was done in Latvia in pest risk zones.,0
In 2016 and 2017 in total 76 pheromone traps were used.,0

Aim of the thesis:,0
To determine the quality of blinking and tear film on the higher order aberrations of the eye.,0
Hypothesis of the tesis:,0
"The quality of the tear film has a high impact on making higher order aberrations – the more a person blinks and the worse the quality of the tear film is, the larger is growth of an higher order aberrations.",0
Tasks of the thesis: 1.To determine the frequency of blinking and its impact on how fast the tear film breaks; 2.To measure the aberration scene and analyse its change between the 4 measurments; 3.To analyse the impact of frequency of blinking and the tear film quality on the change of higher order aberrations.,0
Participants: 15 women in the age of 20 to 25 years participated.,0
None of the participants are in the risk group of dry eye and in everyday life don’t use tear drops and therapies of medicaments.,0
Method:,0
"There were 2 surveys fot the participants: „McMonnies” and „OSDI”, to assure that eyes are in good condition and that the participants are not in the risk group of dry eye.",0
The frequency of blinking and the time of tear film breaking were scaled (TBUT – tear brake up time) with the invasive method.,0
With the help of i.,0
ProfilerPlus each participant was measured in 4 different time cathegories and scenes of the corneal higher order aberrations were scaled.,0
Conclusions:,0
"In a time period of  10-12 seconds while the tear film is drying, the higher order aberrations increases from 0,19 to 1,74 µm, which corresponds to the determination of quality of tear film on complete function of optical system of the eye.",0
"A tear film in bad quality brings to a remarkable growth of optical system`s errors, which brings to weakening the quality of the vision from 0,25 up to 2,50 D. A more frequent blinking brings a faster drought of the tear film, which means that the growth of aberration is higher in a shorter time period.",0
"If the blinking frequency is lower and the quality of tear film is higher, the impact of aberration on the maintance of vision decreases",0
