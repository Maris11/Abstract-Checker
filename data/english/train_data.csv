BMX (Bicycle Motocross) is a specific type of cycling and became more popular when it was included in the 2008 Olympic Games program.,0
The sport is sprint-type and very explosive and requires versatile training from athletes.,0
The main goal of the study is to evaluate the functional parameters of BMX cyclists' physical performance by comparing the results of muscle oxygenation change in the increasing load test obtained with the Moxy device with the results of the cardiopulmonary exercise test..,0
A group of BMX athletes was selected to perform the VO2max test with increasing load to failure.,0
"The results showed the athletes' heart rate and blood pressure at exercise, as well as the athletes demonstrated their aerobic and anaerobic abilities.",0
"Information was collected and BMX sports were characterized and compared with the results of other types of cycling, such as MTB (Mountain Bike) and road cycling athletes.",0
The study highlights the uniqueness of BMX in athletes' physical fitness and competition.,0
The data show high anaerobic performance and good performance after the anaerobic threshold.,0
The study concluded that BMX athletes have good recovery abilities and that they can develop maximum power in a shorter period of time much better than other cycling athletes.,0
Gear transmission is very important for developing and maintaining maximum power.,0
"However, due to the specifics of the load in BMX sports, it is difficult to make accurate measurements and adapt the laboratory experiment all close to BMX sports conditions, so finding and using an alternative device in the real environment could give us a much deeper understanding of BMX athlete physiology.",0
"Cardiometabolic diseases are among most significant causes of mortality in the world, and, since they are largely preventable, widely accessible methods for reducing cardiometabolic risk and identifying the risk factors are needed in order to ensure effective prevention measures.",0
The aim of this bachelor’s thesis was to evaluate the significance of the effect of lifestyle factors on the development of cardiometabolic risk development.,0
This study involved 65 adults within the range of 30 to 54 years old.,0
"Anthropometric measurements were acquired via self-reported anthropometry and the evaluation of lifestyle factors was based on a survey, which was sent to every respondent individually, following an invitation to participate in this study.",0
Anthropometric data was used to calculate the values of cardiometabolic risk factors.,0
The statistical analysis of the data consisted of correlation and covariation analysis.,0
"The obtained results allow to conclude that lifestyle factors, which show significant adverse effects on the development of cardiometabolic risk in a relatively small study population (n=65), are smoking and consumption of alcohol.",0
Global consumption of  pesticides is very high.,0
"Due to their widespread use, pesticides enter the aquatic ecosystems and are common in the environment.",0
"Pollution from pesticides attracts the attention of researchers, as these pesticides can have a significant impact on aquatic ecosystems and consequently animal and human health.",0
The objective of this study is to determine the potential effects of widespread pesticides on aquatic organisms.,0
Using two biotesting methods: the microalgae growth inhibition test and the acute crustacean immobilization test.,0
"In addition to biotesting, survey was conducted to interview farmers, to learn their used pesticide use justification and storage.",0
"During the experiment, the EC50 – effective medial concentrations and LC50 – sublethal concentrations, LOEC - the lowest exposure concentrations at which inhibition of test organisms was observed and the NOEC - the highest concentrations at which no effects on test organisms were observed were determined during the tests.",0
Experimental results show that all selected pesticides have high toxicity.,0
"Highest toxicity in daphnia tests was shown by the insecticide “Proteus OD”, which unfortunately is widely used in the fight against insects, and in the algae tests the herbicide “Broadway Star” (see conclusions).",0
Pesticides with several active substances were found to contribute more rapidly to the inhibition of aquatic organisms than pesticides with only one active substance.,0
Tested zooplankton organisms showed greater sensitivity to pesticides than phytoplankton organisms.,0
"Pesticides that enter water bodies can cause both microalgae un crustaceans’ demise, especially in waters bodies near agricultural land.",0
Farmers emphasize that the use of pesticides is necessary to increase production efficiency and promote farm development.,0
"The assessment for the European Red List of Birds 2015, has indicated that in the last 20  years there has been serious reductions in the distribution and abundance of breeding Common  pochard Aythya ferina, resulting in the European population being upgraded from IUCN Least  Concern status to Vulnerable.",0
In this study we created an overview of the pochards distribution  changes in Latvia by using bird atlas data from three time periods: 1980-1984; 2000-2004;  2013-2017.,0
To evaluate changes in abundance we used data from two long term waterbird  studies in Lake Engure (1958-2019) and Lake Kaņieris (2005-2019).,0
Our atlas analysis indicate that in in the last 33 years species distribution has lessered  signifficantly.,0
Also the breeding population in Lake Engure since the end of nineties has  experienced a dramatic decrease.,0
"Reason for it is a mix of factors – loss of breeding habitat,  decrease of black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus colonies, and increase in predator, especially  American mink Mustela vison, numbers.",0
"In our opinion, it is valid to asses these limiting factors  to the general breeding pochard population in Latvia.",0
"Meanwhile, in the last 14 years breeding  population of pochards in Lake Kaņieris has stayed relatively small, but stable.",0
"According to numerous studies, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by almost all cell types within human body and act as mediators of various biological processes via cell-to-cell communication.",0
Recent studies show that intercellular communication is possible between human microbiota and host cells as well.,0
"In this study, we show that EVs isolated from human blood and urine contain RNA fragments derived from various microorganisms.",0
"The most commonly represented phyla and superphyla in blood and urine were Proteobacteria, PVC group and Terrabacteria.",0
"To determine if the major source of these microbial transcripts is gut microbiome, we developed a method for the isolation of EVs from human stool samples.",0
"Next, we plan to perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of EVs isolated from plasma, urine and stool from the same individuals.",0
"HHV-6 is an omnipresent pathogen which can establish lifelong persistency in its host and is linked to the development of multiple diseases, among them – autoimmune.",0
"Although the link between HHV-6 and autoimmune thyroid disease has been shown, mechanisms elucidating how HHV-6 influences the onset of autoimmunity remain unclear.",0
"HHV-6 possesses a number of immunomodulating properties, which are used to manipulate the host immune system for viral evasion and dissemination.",0
The role of HHV-6 encoded viral chemokine receptors U12 and U51 in the development of autoimmunity was evaluated by using potentially immunogenic synthetic peptides designed from viral amino acid sequences.,0
Peptide immunogenicity and antibody cross reactivity was evaluated using suspension multiplex immunological assay.,0
"HHV-6 was detected in all of the patient’s thyroid gland samples (64/64, 100%) and in 37 of them an active HHV-6 infection was found (37/64, 58%).",0
"The expression of HHV-6 chemokine receptors U12 and U51 was detected in 23 of the patient’s thyroid gland samples (23/64, 36%).",0
"Samples positive for viral chemokine receptors expression had significantly elevated viral loads (p=0,0155).",0
"HHV-6 peptide specific IgG and IgM antibodies were found in patient’s samples, with higher signals for IgM antibodies, which is indicative of reactivation and active HHV-6 infection.",0
"No cross reactivity between HHV-6 peptide specific antibodies and human recombinant CCR1, 3 and 5 was found.",0
Further research is necessary to determine the immunogenicity of HHV-6 gene U12 and U51 encoded proteins.,0
"Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref s.l. root rot causes serious economical losses in European Union, about 790 million euros per year.",0
To limit the spread of root rot in Latvia coniferous stumps over 10 cm in diameter are being protected from Heterobasidion spp.,0
infection using biological control agent containing P. gigantea spores.,0
Previous studies have shown that natural P. gigantea infection is not sufficient to effectively control Heterobasidion spp.,0
prevalence in pine stumps.,0
"To determine Heterobasidion spp. and natural P. gigantea development in small diameter, different height pine stumps, in three plots 300 pine stumps were analysed, half of them 15 cm high and half – 50 cm high.",0
120 stumps in two sample plots were treated with Heterobasidion spp.,0
spore suspension and 180 stumps were left untreated for natural Heterobasidion spp.,0
and P. gigantea infections.,0
To analyse mycelial growth all stumps were cut into 2 to 4 cm thick discs (down till root collar).,0
We determined that in this study P.gigantea natural infection was significantly more prevalent than Heterobasidion spp.,0
natural infection – in only 3% of both treated and untreated stumps after 22 month long incubation period viable Heterobasidion spp.,0
"mycelium could be found, but P. gigantea had spread trough 39% stumps.",0
Therefore natural P. gigantea is a significant factor to control Heterobasidion spp.,0
infection in small diameter pine stumps.,0
"Stump height did not significantly influence the development of natural P. gigantea in small diameter pine stumps, but the incubation period did.",0
"Compared to results obtained after 22 months, after 28 months the average area colonised by P. gigantea was significantly lower.",0
"From all stumps infected by P. gigantea (n=115) in 62,5 % of analysed 50 cm high stumps and in 76,0% of 15 cm high stumps mycelium had spread untill the root collar of the stump.",0
In further reasearch stumps containing viable P. gigantea mycelium could be excavated and their root system analysed to determine the importance of natural P. gigantea in limiting Heterobasidion spp. secondary spread.,0

"AIT patients’ RANTES level was lower (median 418,2 [IQR 113,1 – 803,1] pg/ml) compared to control group (median 1346 [IQR 645 – 2503] pg/ml).",0
This study contains 7 chapter with subdivisions.,0
"The totals amount of 42 references, 12 figures were used in this thesis which has 47 pages.",0
This work was done in Rigas Stradins University Institute of Microbiology and Virology.,0
The determination of the viability of seed with non-differentiated embryos (dust seeds) is complicated due to the small size of seeds and the dependency of seed germination on symbiotic microorganisms.,0
The aim of this work was develop optimal viability testing method using tetrazolium chloride for seeds of different species with non-differentiated seed embryos.,0
"According to the purpose of the work, the tasks we-re: to determine the viability of the seeds of certain species of the Orchidaceae family and Pyroloideae subfamily  using tetrazolium chloride test, to examine the effect of pre-incubation in sucrose solution on the activation of the metabolism of the seeds pri-or to the tetrazolium test, and to determine the proportion of germinating seeds in in vitro conditions.",0
The tetrazolium chloride seed viability test is based on the colouring of viable seed cells as a result of the activity of dehydrogenase enzyme.,0
"Before colou-ring the seeds with tetrazolium chloride, they were disinfected in sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution, which is at the same time chemical scarification of the seeds, with or without prior incubation in sucrose solution.",0
"In order to check the effects of chemi-cal scarification on the test results, the duration of disinfection was modified.",0
"A spe-cialised N1 medium and Murashige & Skoog medium, supplemented with yeast extract, was used to test seed germination in vitro.",0
Scarified seeds were incubated on the nutrient medium in aseptic conditions.,0
The seeds were germinated at +22 °C with or without prior incubation at +5 °C.,0
The seed activity was determined once a week for 16 weeks by counting the protocorms and separately counting protocorms with developed rhizoids.,0
The percentage of viable seeds determined by the tetrazolium test in different scarification treatments was compared with the protocorm count on the medium.,0
The effects of yeast extract concentration on the protocorm development was tested .,0
"The aim of the study was to determine tolerance and ion accumulation of Rumex hydrolapathum plants in the presence of NaCl and heavy metal (cadmium, chromium, nickel and lead) salts.",0
"The plants were cultivated in an automated greenhouse where they were treated with different concentration of the respective substances, and leaf chlorophyll concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured.",0
After harvesting ion analysis was performed in dried plant parts.,0
R. hydrolapathum avoided ion accumulation in young leaves in all treatments.,0
"However, the maximum ion accumulation occurred in old leaves for Na, Cd and Ni, but for Cr and Pb in roots.",0
From the changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence the growth of plants could not be predicted.,0
"R. hydrolapathum could be potentially used for soil remediation polluted with NaCl, cadmium and lead.",0
Sleep deficit and disruption can lead to multiple negative outcomes on human health.,0
"While self-reported sleep quality assessment is subjective, it can be assessed by sleep stages and hormone concentration changes.",0
Sleep stages have qualities reflected on continuous heart rate measurements.,0
Cortisol is one of the hormones which diurnal cycle is influenced by sleep processes.,0
The aim of this work was to find out heart rate and cortisol dynamics’ connection with sleep quality.,0
The study had 10 voluntary participants within ages 20-23.,0
They filled Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and chronotype questionnaires.,0
"Each participant measured their heart rate for three nights, with addition of collecting urine samples for determination of cortisol concentration for each night.",0
"Results show a connection between high and low heart rate variability interval length ratio and sleep quality, that could be explained by slow wave sleep stage effect on sleep quality.",0
Morning cortisol levels and higher evening cortisol levels tend to be in association with lower sleep quality values.,0
The aim of the study was to define possible structural and transcription changes of pericentromeric heterochromatin (PHC) at early stage of the differentiation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells activated with heregulin (HRG).,0
In activation model the changes of transcription dynamics of early stress response genes and pericentromeric satelite DNA were determined in MCF-7 cells after HRG treatment by using qPCR.,0
PHC topology and organization were defined with immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy and image analysis methods.,0
It was discovered that PHC clustering is proportional to count of centromeres and their layout is defined by power-law.,0
HRG causes rapid de-clustering of PHC.,0
"From collected data a hypothesis was posed that PHH de-clustering in cells committed to differentiation cancels its negative position effect, allowing the whole genome transcription activization.",0
Five enzyme complexes that are located within the inner membrane of the mitochondria compose oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system.,0
The OXPHOS system produces up to 90% adenosine triphosphate in cells.,0
OXPHOS system disorders caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders.,0
There is no single specific method for mitochondrial disease diagnostics.,0
The effects of pathogenic mtDNA mutations can be studied using cytoplasmic hybrid cell models.,0
The aim of this work was to evaluate the functionality of OXPHOS system in the cytoplasmic hybrid cell line control group and in a patient cell line with a possible pathogenic mtDNA mutation.,0
"A group of control cell lines was established and the OXPHOS enzyme activities were determined, the protocol of cell viability measurements was optimized and the control group cell viability was determined, a cell line harbouring the m.14894T>C mutation was characterized and analyzed, and the frequency of mutation m.14894T>C in the healthy Latvian population was determined.",0
Right-left asymmetry is a common feature of the nervous system in vertebrates and invertebrates.,0
"Cerebral lateralisation are essential for animal cognition, its disruption can cause neurological disorders such as speech impairment in humans.",0
"Several genetic and environmental factors play an important role to its origin, however, the underlying mechanisms of asymmetrical organisation is unknown.",0
This study shows the developmental and circuit organisation of asymmetrical body (AB) in the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster.,0
Single cell clones and activity dependent synaptic connections generated in this study demonstrate anatomy of various AB neuronal types and constitutes their precise wiring circuit.,0
During early pupa development occurs break in symmetry and then the AB establishes anatomical asymmetry which persist throughout adulthood.,0
Anthropogenic pollution accelerates eutrophication process and is one of the main reasons for reduced ecological quality.,0
This research was performed in order to evaluate how anthropogenic eutrophication has affected the lake’s cladoceran composition and owerall ecological quality by using subfossil cladocera and data from literature.,0
"Results show loss of oligotrophy indicating species, decrease of overall diversity, increase of eutrophication indicationg species during and after the pipe between lake Sekšu and Mazais Baltezers was  operational.",0
"However, the situation has improved over the last 10 years and lake Sekšu has a good restoration potential.",0
NET tumors are the most common oncologic disease out of all cancer types.,0
"Brest cancer, which is one of NET types, is the most common oncological disease amongst women with hundreds of thousands of new cases every year.",0
Since the end of last century radiopharmaceuticals are used for diagnostic of tumours and their metastases in clinical practise.,0
In the last few years a new approach have arised in ocology – theranostics – diagnostic and therapy with tumor specific peptide that is labelled with radionuclide.,0
HA-DOTA-TATE (somatostatin analoge) labelled radionuclides opens door for affordable theranostics for patients.,0
But there are lack of studies about how good or bad HA-DOTA-TATE affinty to SSTR is.,0
That is why this study was performed.,0
"Using three cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SkBr3 and MCF-7) and dermal fibroblast cell line HDFa as control 68Ga and 177Lu labelled HA-DOTA-TATE affinity was measured in those cell lines.",0
Results show that radiolabelled HA-DOTA-TATE have potential to be used in both therapy and diagnostic of NET tumors.,0
Kreslina V. The effect of dendrological parameters and fertilization on vegetation and its provision of ecosystem services in short rotation coppice.,0
"The aim of the study was to determine the effects of fertilizer (sewage sludge and wood ash) on birch and grey alder height and diameter, vegetation and ecosystem services in birch and grey alder stand provided by short rotation coppice.",0
The plantation is located in Skrīveri district in “Pardenči”.,0
Trees were planted in 2011.,0
Four blocks were created.,0
Each of them consisted of control plots and plots fertilized with sewage sludge and wood ash.,0
Vegetation was described in plots.,0
Data about plant species found in birch and grey alder stands were summarized for each sampling time.,0
The survey was conducted from the third to seventh year after planting.,0
The height and diameter of trees was measured to estimate the effect of fertilizer type on tree growth.,0
In the fourth year after planting there were no significant difference between the number and cover of herbaceous plant species and the type of fertilizer (analysis of variance p values 0.08 and 0.09).,0
"In the seventh year after planting, fertilizer (sewage sludge) influenced birch and grey alder height and diameter.",0
Species diversity in the plantation decreased from the third to the seventh year after planting.,0
Birch stands had higher number of herbaceous plant species.,0
"In both of the studied tree species plots, two natural grassland indicator species were found: Dianthus deltoides L. and Dactylorhiza maculata.",0
There were found also two invasive plant species: Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl. and Solidago canadensis L. The highest number and cover of leguminous plant species were found in the birch stand.,0
"Using data from literature the amount of sequestered nitrogen from the atmosphere by Trifolium pratense L. was estimated to be 79,968 kg N2/ha in the third to seventh year after planting, respectively.",0
"Also, the number of nectar plant species was higher in the birch stand, reaching the highest level in the fourth year after planting (13 species).",0
In the seventh year after planting there were eight nectar plant species.,0
There is a little reseaches about wild mammals parasite diversity in Latvia.,0
The aim of present study is to determine the prevalence and endoparasites diversity of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Latvia in the time period from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016.,0
"In the study, it was found that the most common endoparasites in red foxes were Alaria alata (94.2%) and raccoon dogs Uncinaria stenocephala (93.7%).",0
"Analyzing the closeness of the association between parasite species, it was detected that there is a moderate association between the parasite species of red fox lung nematodes Crenosoma vulpis and Eucoleus aerophilus, which tends to be positive.",0
"It was also found that the parasitofauna of red foxes has higher diversity (H=1,67) comparing to that in raccoon dogs (H = 0,47).",0
The age of the red fox was an affecting factor for the presence of endoparasitic species such as Molineus patens and Istmiophora melis.,0
"It was determined that the diversity of red fox endoparasites is not affected by the animal population density, but in raccoon dogs a strongly negative correlation was found between the animal population density and the calculated endoparasite species diversity index.",0
It was previously considered that the flounder has two reproductive strategies – with pelagic and demersal eggs.,0
"In 2018. on the basis of genetic research, it was found that they actually are different species.",0
"Previously described European flounder (Platichthys flesus) spawns pelagic eggs, which require water salinity above 11 ‰ to succesfully reproduce.",0
"Demersal spawning flounder was named Platichthys solemdali, whose egg development requires a lower level of salinity (about 7 ‰).",0
"As Latvia is one of the leading countries in flounder fishery, and potentially both species may inhabit its waters, it would be necessary to find out which of the flounder species (or both) are present in Latvian waters.",0
"It would also be important to carry out flounder stock assesments, as different species may have different stock development trends depending on the environment.",0
"For this study five places were chosen, where P. solemdali and P. flesus would theoretically have different stock proportions – the open sea (Ventspils and two near Liepāja), Irbe Strait (Kolka) and the Gulf of Riga (Saulkrasti).",0
Morphological parameters were measured for the samples collected and compared to perviously available data.,0
Results of this study conclude that it is not possible to distinguish the two species using only morphological features.,0
Future studies could be continued by comparing morphometric results to flounder age and genetically confirmed species.,0
"In Latvia river lamprey makes up to 50% of annual inland fish catch, yet the status of a protected species with limited use has been granted for the species.",0
Events to increase the population of river lamprey have been taking place already from the middle of 20th century – the translocation of spawners over migration obstacles and stocking of artificially bred larvae.,0
"The events are taking place in rivers that already have an existing population of them with the purpose to increase the population, or they are stocked in a river section selected by superficial ecological evaluation.",0
"In order to make these events more efficient, it would be necessary to select the lamprey stocking sites by more various criteria.",0
Macrozoobenthos often is used as a biological indicator of waterbody quality assessment.,0
The aim of this study is to identify macrozoobenthic organisms that could be used to determine the optimal river site where to place population multiplying events.,0
The benthic macrofauna samples were taken in 13 streams and 20 sampling sites.,0
The samples were sorted and identified to the most precise taxonomic rank possible.,0
"The indicator values of macrozoobenthic taxa were calculated in relation to lamprey larvae presence, then significance and importance of said values were analysed in different scales.",0
"By comparing obtained indicator values with the taxa correspondence to the ecology of lamprey larvae, it has been determined which macrozoobenthic taxa presence or absence is the most significant.",0
77 statistically significant indicator values were obtained.,0
"Of them five – Corixidae, Crambidae, Caenis horaria, Platambus maculatus, Radix balthica – were recognized as important indicators, which are to be considered when selecting stream sites in future for releasing river lamprey larvae.",0
"Aim of this work was to explore possible relation between multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) infection and ageing of immune system, and to determine the role of mtDNA mutations in disease and TB pharmacotherapy.",0
The study analysed changes in leukocyte biomarkers - mtDNA copy number and telomere length - and the possible effects of patients' habits and other influencing factors.,0
The results showed that MDR-TB patients had an increased mtDNA copy number and a reduced telomere length compared to controls.,0
Significant changes were observed only among men.,0
"Biomarkers were also affected by smoking, duration of TB treatment and the number of doses received.",0
Several mtDNA variations were identified that could be associated with TB and treatment-related adverse effects.,0
The results indicate a more rapid immunosenescence among MDR-TB patients that may affect the function of immune system.,0
Production of probiotic biomass using lactose-containing industrial substrates.,0
The aim of the study was to investigate the possibility to produce biomass of two probiotic Lactobacillus strains using whey as a substrate and to test the survival of this biomass in curd and cottage cheese to evaluate the possibility of developing a new type of probiotic product.,0
The effect of lactose concentration on the growth of these strains was assessed.,0
"The growth parameters of these strains were studied on sweet and sour whey and compared to the indicators in the MRS medium, and the biomass viability in curd and cottage cheese was assessed.",0
"During the study, pH changes, lactose consumption and lactic acid production were evaluated.",0
Looking at the effect of different lactose concentrations on both strains - Lactobacillus casei-01 optimal lactose concentration value ranges from 30 g/L to 60 g/L but L. casei subsp.,0
rhamnosus only 20 g/L.,0
The highest biomass productivity and yield in whey substrate was observed after 24h of fermentation.,0
Lactose consumption and lactic acid production during fermentation were also studied.,0
"The highest results were shown immediately after 24 hours, after 48 hours productivity decreased.",0
"In both skimmed and whole milk curd, both probiotic strains retained viable cell counts above 106 CFU per gram of curd for at least 7 days and in cottage cheese for at least 8 days at + 4 °C.",0
Both types of whey have been found to be suitable substrates for Lactobacillus casei-01 and Lactobacillus casei subsp.,0
"rhamnosus biomass production, and comparing both types of curd with cottage cheese, cottage cheese had higher survival rate with both strains.",0
"During the study essential experimental methods were mastered: bacteria cultivation methods, biomass determination with spectrophotometer and multimode microplate reader – incubator, lactose determination with HPLC chromatograph and colony forming unit calculations.",0
"Latvia is considered to be the northern border of distribution range of western barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus), so the habitats available here are different from those in the main part of the species` distribution range.",0
"The aim of the study, was to find out, what kind of habitats and summer roosts these bats select in boreal forests in Latvia.",0
"Methods used in study were radiotelemetry, recording of bat calls and evaluation of forest snags.",0
The research shows that B.barbastellus mostly chooses Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) as their summer roosts.,0
"Compared to other tree species, in Scots pine there were more potentially suitable roosts for B.barbastellus.",0
This study shows that boreal forests may be important habitat for these bats.,0
"Environmental quality assessment of the Gulf of Riga using the phytoplankton indicator ""Diatom/Dinoflagellate index"".",0
"In the Master's thesis, the phytoplankton indicator “Diatom / Dinoflagellate index” (Dia / Dino index) was tested in the Gulf of Riga, and the influence of physical (temperature) and hydrochemical (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon) parameters was determined on spring diatom and dinoflagellate maximum biomass and index values.",0
"The index values were calculated by separating the transition (T) and open, coastal (O-C) parts of the gulf.",0
The data on phytoplankton and physico-chemical parameters from 1976 to 2019 available in database of the Latvian Institute of Hydroecology were used.,0
"Dia / Dino index from the average and maximum biomass of spring diatoms and dinoflagellates, as well the alternative silicon consumption index have been calculated and the threshold values of good environmental status (GES) have been determined.",0
In the course of the work  was found out that the “Diatom / Dinoflagellate index” indicator can be used to assess the environmental status of the Gulf of Riga.,0
"This indicator mainly characterizes food pathway in the ecosystem, which complies with the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) food web (D4) and may indicate silica limitation caused by eutrophication (D5).",0
Forest fires have a significant role in nutrient cycling and biodiversity.,0
Soil mites (Acari: Oribatida) are important decomposers of organic matter.,0
Prescribed burning can provide important information about the post–pyrogenic succession.,0
"The aim of this work is to determine effects of burning on soil mite communities, vegetation and soil parameters in a Scots pine forest and succession in a two–year period.",0
"After the burning species communities are composed of species, that had high population density before the disturbance.",0
"Population density and diversity is low after the burn, but in two years there is a significant increase.",0
"Significant vegetation and abiotic factor (relative moisture, pH, thickness of O horizon) changes are observed and correlation with mite density, diversity and multiple observed families have been found.",0
"Inermittent fasting, which has become popular in the last decade, is used as one of the methods to regulate body weight.",0
"Measures to regulate body weight and fat mass are becoming more and more important both in the world and in Latvia, as the number of people suffering from excessive fat mass accumulation and related cardio-metabolic and skeletal diseases is increasing.",0
"The aim of the study was to evaluate which of the methods - correction of the diet, purposeful, regular physical exercises or a combination of the two previous mentioned methods causes more pronounced favorable changes in the composition of body tissues.",0
The study involved 25 women aged 35-50.,0
"They formed three study groups, with different study protocols for a 6-week hands-on study: Group 1 - followed the intermittent fasting pattern ""8:16 hours"", Group 2 - followed the intermittent fasting model ""8:16 hours"" and during the study side by side performed the moderate regular, purposeful physical exercises; Group 3 - performed moderate, regular physical exercises, but did not follow the intermittent fasting.",0
"The division of the subjects into groups was created by purposefully adapting to the possibilities of the study participants, so that during the study it would be possible to more easily adapt the daily regime to the needs of the study.",0
"The waist, hips and thighs circumferences were determined for all subjects, as well as skin folds measurements for triceps, thigh and suprailiac were performed with a caliper Body weight and body composition parameters were determined with bioelectrical impedance analyzer.",0
The changes of anthropometric and body composition parameters during the 6-week study in all groups of study participants were compared.,0
"The results of the study show that the intermittent fasting, as well as the intermittent fasting together with physical activities, show favorable (although not statistically reliable) relative fat mass, as well as changes in visceral fat level and visceral fat area, compared to the physical exercise regimen without intermittent fasting, however, no significant changes in skeletal muscle mass were observed in any of the study groups.",0
"As a result of the study, it can be concluded that an intermittent fasting, as well as purposeful physical exercise, is a way to maintain a relatively constant composition of body tissues, without limiting oneself to the variety and quantity of food if food is consumed during a certain time of day.",0
"Keywords: intermittent fasting, physical exercises, body composition, weight loss, visceral fat.",0
Scots pine is the most widespread and one of the most economically important conifer species.,0
Mostly for the increacement of its biomass Scots pine uses current carbon assimilates while previous reserves in a form of wood rays can be used as well.,0
"During variable, especially extreme, climate conditions proportion of wood rays, therefore the amount of available reserves, can vary which can affect increacement of wood biomass in the future.",0
By measuring the volume of wood rays the response of stress to meteorological factors can be quantified and the importance of social status of trees in stand can be determined.,0
The study was performed in an economical Scots pine Myrtillosa stand located at Tome.,0
During the study cores were gathered from trees of I and III Kraft classes.,0
"Anatomical cuts were made in each annual ring, both early and late wood.",0
The samples then were stained and photographed using high resolution equipment.,0
Quantitative analysis of obtained images was performed using Win Cell.,0
Mixed type models were implemented for comparison of mean values of wood rays parameters.,0
Time series and correlation analysis were used to identify correlation between meteorological factors and parameters of wood rays.,0
Principal component analysis was performed to indicate trends of parameters of wood rays.,0
"Statistically significant difference of parameters of wood rays was higher between early and late wood than between Kraft classes, pointing at high individuality of trees.",0
"While the current meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation and drought) affect parameters of current wood rays, factors of previous growing season show the biggest effect.",0

Young swimmers'knoweledge of dietary supplements.,0
SUMMARY  The aim of Jekaterina Netača's master's thesis was to find out the knowledge of young swimmers aged 14-21 about nutritional supplements and their experience with their usage.,0
"Global research reflects the widespread use of dietary supplements by athletes, but their choice is not always reasonable and safe.",0
The need to study this issue in depth is justified by the lack of research on the use of supplements amongst the population of Latvian athletes.,0
There is also no clear idea about their knowledge and sources of information used in connection with nutritional supplements.,0
"The main tasks of the study were to translate and validate a standardized self-assessment questionnaire “Survey on supplements in swimming sports” and to adapt it to the Latvian population, as well as to find out the habits, frequency, reasons and knowledge of the safe use of supplements for young swimmers.",0
"The results of the study showed that among swimmers there is a large - 71,5% (n = 113; 95%TI = 0,64-0,78) number of supplement users (p˂0,05).",0
Responses regarding the reasons and why athletes use supplements revealed inconsistencies and suggest widespread misinformation among athletes.,0
"The study also showed that the majority of respondents rate their knowledge of supplements as superficial, and only 16,2% (n = 25; 95%TI = 0,11-0,23) consider it good.",0
"The study also leads to the conclusion that there is a lack of sufficient and appropriate understanding of the dangers of using nutritional supplements, which increases the risk of using non-anti-doping products.",0

"The first two steps – pretreatment and hydrolysis - in producing bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass are essential, as they ground  the outcome for next ones – fermentation and distillation.",0
"Therefore these steps are intensively studied and many physical, chemical and biological routes developed.",0
Yet there is a need to adjust the optimal treatment for each type of biomass.,0
"In this work I evaluate the effect of explosive decompression pretreatment applied on barley straw and hay, as well as optimal hydrolysis temperature evaluation is presented.",0
"The key findings are consistent with literature that the optimal pretreatment temperature is 150º C. Meanwhile, it is doubtful that the energy required for this kind of pretreatment is justifiable, based on ethanol yield increase after fermentation.",0
"Moreover, in case with enzyme from Trichoderma reesei it is shown that glucose yield increase after hydrolysis is easy achievable with increase of hydrolysis temperature for 10 - 20º C. These findings confirm that for each type of biomass there is a need for optimal pretreatment method and hydrolysis conditions.",0
"The aim of this study was to develop a precision medicine test, which is based on the detection of somatic mutations in breast cancer patient tissues and monitoring them in the circulation during the progression of the disease.",0

"Intermittent fasting diet is a relatively new approach for weight loss, improvement of body tissue composition and health condition overall.",0
"The main feature of intermittent fasting diet is the control of calory intake periods, rather than the calory intake.",0
In this study two intermittent fasting diet models were compared: time restricted and weekly fasting model.,0
"We observed an impact of aforementioned models on anthropometric parameters, including body tissue and biochemical composition of blood plasma before and after the diet.",0
"For this aim kaliper and ultrasonography methods were used in order to define relative amount of fat and width of various fat layers, accordingly.",0
"Also, biochemical blood tests were performed.",0
"The results showed statistically significant difference of weight changes before and after diets, which means that both diet models are similarly effective.",0
The aim of this study was to develop a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol suitable for sedentary people and to comparatively test its effect on metabolic rate (MR) in the post-exercise period.,0
"Two exercise protocols were used: HIIT and moderate, continuous intensity training (MICT).",0
HIIT consisted of twenty 30-second bouts at 85% Pmax interspersed with 60- second active recovery periods with 50% of Pmax.,0
MICT was a single continuous bout at 65% Pmax.,0
MR was determined using indirect calorimetry.,0
HIIT and MICT protocols were tested on two subjects (21 and 20 years).,0
"The results show that both tests have a similar effect on MR in the post-exercise period, but the HIIT was more exciting.",0
"The developed HIIT protocol is suitable for sedentary persons, but its impact on MR should be further tested by increasing the number of participants.",0
Environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals has been growing rapidly in recent years.,0
"They are potentially bioactive and may have a significant effect on water quality and aquatic organisms, but eco-toxicological information is incomplete or non-existent for many pharmaceuticals.",0
The study was performed to determine the potential effects of widely used and in ecotoxicology little studied pharmaceutical products on aquatic organisms.,0
"In the course of the work, the LC50, EC50, LOEC and NOEC values of the products were determined.",0
The results of the experiment showed that for aquatic organisms toxic effects were observed in concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg·l-1 in acute tests.,0
"In chronic tests, the inhibitory effect was observed at significantly lower concentrations (0.25 - 13 mg·l-1).",0
"Pharmaceutical products containing sulpiride (antidepressant), ipidacrine (NS stimulant) and chloropyramine (antiallergic) stand out with the highest toxicity.",0
"The persistent release of pharmaceuticals into water bodies can reduce the reproductive capacity or viability of crustaceans and inhibit algal growth, especially at the outlets of pharmaceutical plants.",0

The study involved 47 individuals aged 18-35 with different smoking habits.,0
"Smoking experience, physical activity level and anthropometric measures were determined using a questionnaire method.",0
Blood biochemical parameters characterizing lifestyle and visceral adiposity were analyzed from the literature data.,0
"The results of current study indicate that parameters associated with visceral adiposity in smokers with low smoking history and intensity, but higher everyday physical activity level do not substantially differ from nonsmokers.",0
Thus the disfunction of adipose tissue is rather the result of several factors.,0
"Smoking cessation causes an increased accumulation of visceral adipose tissue, and the effect is mostly observed in the first two years post-quitting.",0

In this thesis work a method for studying optical properties and determination of thickness of oxide layer for porous anodic aluminum oxide (PAAO) is studied.,0
Specimens for this study are obtained by anodizing process.,0
The method is based on detection and analysis of reflected light from the sample using a multilayer mathematical model.,0
The model is based on electromagnetic wave interaction with interfaces of sample layers and fields propagation in the medium.,0
The model is used to determine the coefficient of reflection of light as a function of wavelength of light and the thickness of aluminum oxide layer.,0
Results are obtained by fitting calculations with experimental data.,0
The experimental part consists of designing an optical system and combining it with an existing anodizing system.,0
The spectrum of reflected light is recorded during the anodization process.,0
The purpose of this work is to improve a method for obtaining aluminum oxide with a specific thickness.,0
Samples are later used to create refractometric sensors.,0

"Calculations of land use change can be carried out in a partly automated process using geographic information system (GIS) tools, which make calculations easier to perform, reduce time consumption for this task and occasional human errors.",0
The aim of this study is to improve the methodology for the development of land use and land use change matrix in the national GHG inventory system using geospatial data of National forest inventory (NFI) and auxiliary data.,0
"This methodology uses geospatial NFI data and auxiliary information provided by the Land parcel information system (LPIS) and stand-wise forest inventory, and it improves the accuracy and consistency of land use and land use change matrix, providing the ability to apply the same land use accounting method for the entire reporting period since 1990 without a significant increase in uncertainty.",0
The developed method determines land use change in a 5-year period by comparing three subsequent NFI cycles.,0
"To determine the actual land use category in a specific year, adjustment of weights is performed for different land use categories.",0
Linear interpolation is used to determine year-by-year transitions.,0
"The land use change matrix, elaborated in this study, shows similar trends of land use change, if compared to the currently reported data in the National GHG inventory; however, elaboration of the matrix does not require time-consuming manual sorting of change in the NFI plot geometry, which are not associated with actual change in land use.",0
Significant automation of these calculations using GIS tools allows these calculations to be made faster and more precisely.,0

"Most of the long-term operational infrastructure in Latvia, including the drainage ditch network, has been developed before compliance with climate change is included in the planning process.",0
It is therefore essential to obtain accurate data on the condition of the ditch network in order to be able to assess its suitability for foreseeable conditions and the need for improvement measures.,0
"The aim of the Master's thesis is to develop a method for the identification of the ditch network and culverts for the needs of surface runoff modeling in Latvian conditions, using remote sensing data, as well as to evaluate the ditch network functionality in cases of extreme precipitation rates.",0
"The study area consists of 11 objects throughout Latvia, of which 3 are located on agricultural land and 8 on forest land.",0
Drainage ditch network has been identified using a digital elevation model and technical condition of the ditches are assessed.,0
"Using the ditch network, locations of culverts in the aim of elevation model correction, have been identified, as well as the effectiveness of these methods has been assessed.",0
"Using the obtained results, hydrological modeling during extreme precipitation was performed.",0
"The developed method allows to identify the ditch network with an accuracy of up to 96% on agricultural lands, but on forest lands - 90 to 95% depending on the type of ditches.",0
"The technical condition of the ditches can be assessed with the accuracy R2 0,9383 and 0,9462; the depth and width of the ditches, respectively.",0
"The study concludes that the ditch network in the research objects on agricultural and forest lands during extreme precipitation, in most cases, is not overloaded and the condition of the existing ditches is not a limiting factor for rainwater drainage.",0
Further research is needed to reduce the potential for errors and to improve culvert identification methods.,0
Mobility opportunities of citizens have a significant impact on the local development.,0
The accessibility of public transport is an important condition for this.,0

"For this reason, significant improvements are needed in the soil mapping process, paying attention specifically to the signs of soil degradation.",0
"In this scientific research, the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data has been studied to detect the felling areas.",0
"Analogous studies proving the utilization of SAR and also in particular Sentinel-1 sensors in forestry have been conducted both in the world and in Latvia, but there is a lack of studies that explain the correlation of SAR, forestry processes and weather conditions.",0
"Therefore the effect of weather conditions on the received SAR backscatter intensity was researched in this paper, because as the weather changes, so do the dielectric properties of the vegetation and the surface, resulting in a change in the values of the received SAR backscatter.",0
The study was developed because it is important to do forestry monitoring regardless of weather conditions.,0
"A model was developed by Sentinel-1 data, ERA5",0
"-Land climatic weather reanalysis dataset and multiple regression analysis, that enables to predict the effect of the main dielectric constant influencing weather components on Δσ0 values.",0
"This paper proved that the selected weather components in VH polarization can explain 62,7% of Δσ0 values, but in the case of VV polarization, 54,0% of Δσ0 values can be explained.",0
"The study showed that VV polarization values, rather than VH polarization values, are more unstable towards vegetation changes, and only VH polarization data can be used for forestry detection, as only VH polarization showed that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean values of forested reference areas and felling areas.",0

Possible hazards and problems with other countries' lake management programs will be explored.,0
The work studied the concept of the Vecpiebalga county’s lake management.,0
"Chemical analyses of the lake’s Alauksts water as well as surveys of shores of other public lakes - Kaives, Ineša, Juvera, Taurenes, Tauna and Zobola lakes - were carried out in the study.",0
Latvian state legislation on the management of lakes and their shores was also studied.,0
Vecpiebalga county is one of the less populous counties of Latvia.,0
"At the beginning of the research,  a hypothesis was put forward that the limited financial resources needed could make it difficult for local authorities to succeed in lake management.",0
"However, during this research, it was discovered that the municipality has succeeded in effective lake management in most of the public lakes, excluding the lakes  Tauna and Zobola, which are challenging to manage due to poor access to them.",0
"During the work, it was clarified that the environmental quality of lake Alauksts has improved since the adoption of the concept in 2015, and it is no longer subject of increased eutrophication as well as it is no longer polluted.",0
The thesis consists of 90 pages.,0
It contains 23 tables and 20 figures.,0

Soil mapping data from Soviet era (1959 - 1991) is used for calculating carbon dioxide emissions from agricultural land in Latvia.,0
"For now, they are the only spatial data available on agricultural land soils across the country.",0
"Additional information on soils of agricultural lands, such as biologically valuable grasslands, is provided by soil samples collected and analyzed within the framework of projects of the Latvian State Forest Research Institute “Silava” (Latvijas Valsts mežzinātnes institūts “Silava” 2013), as well as soil data from the LUCAS Soil database (Orgiazzi et al. 2017).",0
A comprehensive assessment of the quality and spatial coverage of soil data is needed to obtain an objective picture of the potential use of soil data to calculate CO2 emissions from agricultural lands.,0
The aim of the Master's thesis is to evaluate the quality of soil data available in Latvia for calculating CO2 emissions from agricultural land.,0
"The Master's thesis has assessed the compliance of the coverage of historical soil maps with the currently used agricultural lands, assessment of the area of organic soils and calculation of CO2 emissions in the counties of the study area has been performed, as well as the use of historical soil maps and the role of soil mapping scale in the calculation of CO2 emissions.",0
The results of research shows that the currently available soil data and their interpretation provide different levels of CO2 emissions.,0
"Inaccuracies and significant differences in emission calculations are caused by outdated soil information about soil subtypes, the scale of soil mapping, as well as differences in the input data of agricultural land areas.",0
Pathologies in the fish fossils from the Upper Devonian Ketleri and Tervete Fromations have been studied in the Masters Thesis.,0
"The paleontological material from field work of 2018, 2019 and Latvian University Geological museum collection has been studied.",0
Samples with pathologies were selected and classified.,0
Sarcopterygian and placoderm scales and armour plates have been studied in detail.,0
"The determined damages were described, microphotographs and macrophotographs were made.",0
Histologic structure of scales with pathologies has been studied in the cross-sections and using computed tomography.,0
"Pathologies caused by ectoparasite, endoparasite, disease and predator action as well as post mortem damages.",0
It has been determined that pathologies found on fossils from both Tervete and Ketleri Formations show no significant difference.,0
"It has been determined that ectoparasite  traces in placoderms and sarcopterygians morphologicaly show no difference, so it can be concluded that both fish groups had the same parasites.",0
The damage traces from both Ketleri and Tervete Formations are very similar and it can be concluded that fish parasites from Ketleri Time until Tervete Time have changed very little.,0

"Based on the theoretical knowledge and the author's research, proposals for the development of housing policy were developed, as well as conclusions about the existing policy framework.",0
"According to the proposals made by the author, it can be concluded that an important precondition for the implementation of housing policy is cooperation between state, regional and local government institutions that ensure the right to housing.",0
The topic of the master's thesis is Planning shrinking city: example of Daugavpils.,0
"Since 1992, the population of Daugavpils has decreased by 35.3% or 45015 inhabitants.",0
"In Latvian cities such as Riga and Liepāja, which are marked in the Atlas of Shrinking Cities, research has been conducted on the causes of shrinkage, development forecasts, the impact of shrinkage and sources of shrinking resilience, but in the second largest city of Latvia, an important center of socio-economic development on the eastern border of Latvia.",0
no such studies have been performed.,0
"Therefore, the aim of the work is to develop proposals for the city of Daugavpils, based on European and world good practice examples and socio-economic processes.",0
The work is developed in three parts: in the introductory part the theoretical framework is created and the experience of solutions of shrinking cities is identified.,0
"The part of the research describes the situation, tendencies and development planning framework of Daugavpils city, as well as surveys of the Center and the new building area.",0
"In the part of the research results, proposals for Daugavpils city development guidelines are developed and it is concluded that Daugavpils is a shrinking city, thus the fact of shrinkage must be taken into account when developing city development planning documents.",0
"These documents now set out the approaches of the world's shrinking cities to managing shrinkage, but at the same time include the trends of 'growing' cities.",0
"Keywords: shrinkage, decline, planning, shrink smart, Daugavpils",0
Mono industrial settlements in Latvia: the case of “Pilsētciemati” is devoted to the evaluation and analysis of the development of planned mono industrial urban settlements in Latvia.,0
"The planned mono industrial urban settlements are spatial manifestations of the particular time they were built, characterized by distinct urban pattern and symbolic representations.",0
"The purpose of research is to examine the planned mono industrial settlements in the context of Latvia, analysing the changing patterns of urban morphology and the socio-demographic structure across four case studies representing distinctive urban development decades.",0

"In the master's thesis, data on the inventory of ground vegetation species in the old pine forest near Mazsalaca have been collected and analyzed.",0
"The inventory was conducted in 1994, 1996, and 2006 by the Institute of Biology University of Latvia.",0
The main goal of the master thesis is to find out whether such an inventory of ground vegetation species can be used in long-term research of the forest ecosystem.,0
"By creating a graphical representation of the occurrence of species, as well as the assessment of changes in the number of species and the projected cover, it is possible to observe the variability of all these parameters from 1994 to 2006.",0
"Although Latvia's performance in the use of renewable energy sources for energy production is one of the best in the European Union (EU), ranking Latvia third in this category among EU countries, the contribution of wind energy to this merit is insignificant, and recent efforts to change this situation has resulted in active local community resistance and the rejection of the wind farm by the municipality.",0
"Within the framework of the master's thesis, the author has studied good practices in other countries in promoting the acceptability of wind energy; among other wind energy stakeholders in the workshop organized by WinWind project identified initiatives and actions that would stimulate the establishment of community wind farms in Latvia; by means of a survey identified the opinion of the population on the desired wind energy development in Latvia and its acceptance drivers, as well as acknowledged through interviews the opinion of Latvia's current wind park developers on current obstacles to successful wind energy development in Latvia, necessary support instruments and quality of dialogue with local community and local municipality.",0
"Considering the obtained results and conclusions, the work includes recommendations for Latvian policy makers and wind park developers to promote the acceptance and socially inclusive deployment of wind energy in Latvia.",0
"Outstanding universities and colleges are perceived as special places, different from the urban environment, less than the process of education and research.",0
The physical form of the university confirms its special status with centuries-old buildings and new structures within the urban environment.,0
"The mission, traditions, values and discoveries of knowledge transfer at the university space are still an asset.",0
This master's thesis studies the physical form and significance of the activities within the built environment of higher education institutions – the main basic elements of the campus – that take place or are planned in it.,0
"In order to ensure the continuity of knowledge and cognitive processes, the physical form of universities is constantly changed and adapted to the needs of general public: education, research and commercialization of knowledge of the 21st Century.",0
"HEIs also make their contribution to the society on their campus grounds, which can be studied and perceived as part of the urban environment.",0
"Within the framework of this paper, as a result of theoretical substantiation and comparative research, proposals for the spatial development of Riga Stradinss University campus in Pardaugava, Riga are presented.",0
"The Master's thesis is dedicated to exploring the forest sukcession process of Gauja National Park over the next 500 years, taking into account different scenarios for management regimes.",0
"Forest succession modelling has been performed with a LANDIS II forest simulation model, which has been used for the first time in Latvia and has been validated in the framework of this work.",0
"The results of the simulation have been analysed in the Fragstat models, concluding that the occurrence of Populus tremula, Salix caprea and Alnus incana in the landscape depends on the presence of the disturbance, while the Picea abies reduces the prevalence of other species.",0
"The current community of tree species is a serial community and is considered to be ecological unstable, and it is constantly changing in certain developmental pathways to reach the growth of monodominants as a society of climax.",0
"Consequently, the naturalness reduces the diversity of tree species, whereas forestry activity increases the number and diversity of tree species, which is an indicator of serial community stage.",0
"It is concluded that the present conditions in the nature protection zone of the Gauja National Park are effective in promoting the naturalness of the forest landscape, whereas in the strict regime zone of the Gauja National Park they are not effective in ensuring the naturalness.",0
"Grūbe, G. “Population aging trends in Latvian Counties” Master theses.",0
"Riga, University of Latvia, Faculty of Geography and Earth Sciences, p 95.",0
"In Latvia, significant changes in the population have been observed for a long time.",0
"Systematic population decline is a result of natural movement and migration, as well as of rapid population ageing.",0
"These trends have an influence on the development of economic, public finances as well as on population number and employment.",0
"As the population ages, older individuals become proportionally largest part of the total population, which is one of the most important demographic processes today.",0
"Virtually all countries are expected to face an ageing population shortly, yet this will occur at different levels and times.",0
Significant changes can be observed as well in the age structure of the population in Latvia.,0
"The working-age population tends to gradually decrease, while the proportion of pensioners is increasing.",0
"Such trends will have a significant impact not only on economic and political growth but also on overall regional and national development, as the care of older people requires additional costs for public pensions as well as for health care.",0
The objective of the Master theses is to assess population ageing trends in Latvian Counties.,0
"To achieve the objective, the past studies results on population ageing trends were gathered, its expressions and consequences in the world and Latvia were looked at, as well as a statistical analysis of collected data was performed.",0
The assessment of spatial differences of the ageing process of the population was performed based on the newly created cartographic material.,0
"The results indicated that a major problem for the future will not only be the population decline but also the consequences of it – the shortage or the less availability of labour, which already causes and will have an even greater impact on the Latvian economy.",0
"The Master theses consist of 94 pages, 17 figures, 10 tables and 13 attachments.",0
"Transport emissions are one of the main air pollutants in Riga, thus city’s air quality standards are exceeded every year.",0
"To address this, several traffic flow optimization tools are being used – one of the tools often used in Europe is the construction of “Park and Ride” near the city borders.",0
"Unfortunately, the development of the “Park and Ride”, which has been planned in Riga for several years, is not being implemented and the problem of congestion and poor air quality remains relevant.",0
The aim of the master's thesis is to evaluate the location of the “Park and Ride” in the planning documents and to develop proposals for their location in Riga.,0
"The study concludes that out of the 27 “Park and Ride” planned in Riga development plans, 21 do not meet the main good location conditions - they are located too close to the city center, they do not have good enough public transport connections, or they are located in densely populated neighborhoods, far from city entrances and highways.",0
"There is also a lack of public transport lanes in the city, which significantly reduces the potential benefits of the planned “Park and Ride” facilities.",0
"The planning of “Park and Ride” in Riga is still incomplete, but positive development tendencies are observed, which are hindered by insufficient cooperation between Riga City Council departments and other institutions.",0
"The results of the research are based on surveys, interviews with experts and evaluation of the territorial development planning documents and the “Park and Ride” development plans.",0
The aim of Master Thesis is to research land use in the habitats of Lesser Spotted Eagle for development of agri-environment measures.,0

This thesis is dedicated to the study of autonomous learning of the German language among students.,0
"This study is motivated by a direct experience of author during Erasmus exchange program, where students had necessity to learn German language and communicate in intercultural environment.",0
"As a result, the possibilities, and ways of language learning among students, as well as the autonomy in this process, were thoroughly examined.",0
An analysis of related bibliography has shown that there is a limited amount of literature that specifically focuses on learning the German language among students in the context of the Erasmus program.,0
"In particular, little is known about their goals, preferences, and favorite techniques and strategies.",0
"The aim of the study is not only to determine the methods students use to learn the German language, but also to find out how effective self-study is and whether it is more popular than learning a language with a teacher or in language courses.",0
"In order to achieve this goal, the study and review of the scientific and methodological literature was conducted in the theoretical part.",0
"The practical part consists of examination of the results, obtained from the survey among 125 international students learning German.",0
"The bachelor's thesis deals with the motivation of secondary school students to learn German, as well as the use of E-Learning applications for language learning.",0
The aim of the study is to find out with the help of a questionnaire whether secondary school students use any of the E-Learning applications to learn German.,0
33 students from Salaspils Secondary School No. 2 and Riga Secondary School No. 13 participated in the survey.,0
"The results showed that secondary school students are motivated to learn German and believe that it would be needed in the future for work, travel, or education.",0
The working hypothesis was not confirmed.,0
"In Latvia, a country with strong political and legal support for strengthening the state language, one of the largest languages in the world - Spanish – also enters on a certain historical and geopolitical background.",0
"The master's thesis studies the linguistic attitude of the Latvian population towards a foreign language, including learning Spanish.",0
"Analytical, descriptive and comparative method is used in the work, for data analysis - two surveys and several structured interviews with industry specialists.",0
"There is a generally a favorable linguistic environment for learning Spanish in Latvia - it is possible to learn it in general education schools, language courses, private language centers.",0
It is also possible to obtain an official proof of the knowledge of Spanish at the DELE examination center.,0
"However, the prevalence and popularity of the Spanish language is not as high as it could be in Latvia, based on the findings of the study.",0
"Lack of information, lack ofunderstanding of educational laws or linguistic prejudices may be an issue, with English being the priority foreign language in most schools.",0
"Spanish could become an equal competitor of English in the system of foreign languages to be acquired, moreover, the regulatory framework of the educational process does not stipulate that English is a compulsory foreign language.",0
"Higher education would also require a bachelor's program in Spanish, which would ensure the continuity of the educational stages by preparing highly qualified and professional language specialists in Europe's multilingual environment.",0
"Key words: Spanish, state language, foreign language, language attitude, education system, normative acts, teaching.",0
"A retrospective analysis shows that the number of international migrants has doubled in the last 30 years, and that this increase mainly concerns the countries of Western Europe.",0
This shows that the problem related to the discourse on immigration is current today.,0
We did research on the political discourse linked to immigration in France and Belgium.,0
We compared both the rhetorical and the linguistic aspects of the argument.,0

Drawing conclusions that the author's novels have similar both content and stylistic features that are characteristic  of the genre of modern erotic novels.,0
"The literary translator may also be regarded as a co-author of the work, since neither the excellent knowledge of languages (both source language and target language) nor the use of the same translation strategies guarantees the same outcome (target text).",0
In the translation of fiction or literary works the translator's subjectivity factor is the key.,0
"The translation into the target language is influenced by the translator's knowledge of languages, language sense, vocabulary, linguistic richness, the experience of the translator, his or her knowledge of the country, environment, culture, people, including courage and daring, the ability to identify with the author of the work.",0
These are all considered to be subjective indicators that cannot be measured according to certain criteria.,0
"This work looks at different translation strategies and approaches, both from a theoretical point of view and by analysing their application in the two translations (performed independently from each other) of the autobiographical novel “Becoming” of the former first lady of the United States of America.",0
"As a result, there are clear indications of the inevitable effect of the subjectivity factor in literary translation.",0

The methodology of this research was Qualitative Content analysis and Descriptive analysis.,0
Content analysis was used to help spot phonetic SD and to see them better within the story.,0
Descriptive analysis on the other hand was used to describe phonetic stylistic devices features and their function within LOTR.,0
"Research revealed, that onomatopoeia often used similar words to describe the same effect.",0
While other interesting feature was alliteration usage while creating proper nouns.,0
"However, the main purpose of these phonetic stylistic devices is to create a rhythmic reading and it serves to the reader so that they can understand text more easy.",0
"This master`s thesis looks at the newest autobiographical novels, written in the last ten years.",0
The aim is to find out how the autobiography appears in the latest Latvian novel and what is different between each one.,0
"The idea of the master`s thesis is to create a theoretical and practical insight into the study of autobiography in novels with a narrative and biographical method, which has not been used very often in researches so far.",0
"The study concludes that autobiography in the latest Latvian novel is manifested through the following features: the author's distancing in the third person narration, childhood representation, the mix of the times, author's writing motivation, memory category, historical collective experience context, narrative construction, social status.",0

The Master's thesis covers the studies of the conceptual Latvian literature published within the last twenty years (2000-2020) by highlighting distinct and chrestomathic examples of Latvian authors integrating conceptualist approach into their writing.,0
The Master's thesis is intended as a theoretical and practical introduction to the analysis of conceptualism in Latvian literature.,0
"Up until recently this field of literature has been neglected as it has only been mentioned in some reviews, but there are no analytical studies available in Latvian devoted to this topic.",0
"The conclusion of the research is that conceptualism in Latvian literature is still only at the dawn of development, so the works inspected in the thesis do not correspond to an assessed sentiment of conceptualism in Latvian literature, but rather form an initial perception, which is likely to become the basis for further development of conceptualism in Latvian literature.",0
"The aim behind the master’s thesis “Popular science literature as a tool to educate Latvians in the first half of the 19th century” is to research Latvian popular science literature from the end of 18th century (starting in 1796) through to mid-19th century, describing it in the context of educating Latvians.",0
"In the theory section, there is an insight given to the popular enlightment ideas of the Baltics, with a special focus on enlightenment within the sciences.",0
"The thesis covers the beginning and development of popular science literature in Latvia and also looks at the question of Latvian education, looking more specifically at periodical literature as one of the main educational tools in the enlightenment age.",0
"In the practical part, in the context of the popular enlightment age’s ideas, there is an analysis of the popular science literature that was published in the first half of the 19th century about zoology, more explicitly looking for and analysing the similarities and didactic strategies that the authors present to the reader.",0
"The research analyses the periodical literature that was published at the end of the 18th century and in the first half of the 19th century – magazine “Latviska Gada Grāmata” (1797– 1798), newspapers “Latviešu Avīzes” (1822–1915), “Tas Latviešu Ļaužu Draugs” (1832– 1846), as well as calendars.",0
Owner’s manuals are both technical and public relations documents because they indicate principles of correct and safe operation and their quality influences the user’s impression of the manufacturer.,0
The purpose of the research is to determine what translation strategies were used in the Latvian translation of a Volvo V70/XC70 owner’s manual in English published in 2016 and to evaluate the quality of the translation.,0
"In order to achieve the purpose, relevant theoretical materials were compiled, and on this basis a comparative analysis of the translation was carried out.",0
The author has deemed the translation generally unsuccessful and provided suggestions for preventing the shortcomings discovered therein.,0
"The interaction between the languages and the legal systems of contact languages takes place in a variety of ways, including culture-specific elements to understand words and word groups that define specific concepts for a specific country and culture.",0
"Different strategies are used to achieve this goal: transliteration, i.e. imitation of words in Latvian or Russian (depending on the translation direction), calking, or translation of each part separately, and descriptive translation.",0
Who is the recipient of the translation?,0
This question is important because the answer to it depends on the choice of vocabulary.,0
"If the translation is intended for, for example, a philological journal, the interpreter will choose style records that differ, for example, from where the translation is intended for the wider audience.",0
This choice depends on the strategy and translation algorithm chosen by the interpreter.,0
Cognitive information in these types of texts is specific to the terms.,0
Some of which are known not only for lawyers and field professionals but also for native speaker.,0
"Translation of legal texts is a set of rules, means, types and techniques to be used for successful intercultural communication in the field of judicial knowledge, regarding the knowledge of legal terminology and the different styles of legal texts in source language and destination language.",0
"The aim of the work “Frame drum bubyns tradition in Latgale” is to study and characterize the frame drums bubyns as a musical instrument, its play and the boundaries of tradition in the early 21st century.",0
"There is very little previous research on frame drums in Latvia, almost no researches have been made of the use of frame drums in instrumental music at the beginning of the 21st century.",0
"In the work, the author has compiled scientific and practical information about the use of frame drums in Latgale in various music situations, their distribution, structure, making technology, musical properties, types of play, repertoire.",0
"Much attention is on the traditions of instrument making and playing, as well as the personal creativity and imagination of an individual musician.",0
"The work is mainly based on the comparative method, most of the new data have been obtained in field research, as well as by conducting interviews and surveys in the Internet.",0
"The author has reconstructed bubyns playing techniques based on certain playing elements recorded in the author's own and other researchers' field research in Latgale, guesses and interpretations of bubyns playing elements found in literature and folklore materials, comparative data on frame drum play in traditional culture-related lands - Lithuania and Belarus, as well as the morphological potential of the instrument - techniques that the author has experimentally found by researching the musical possibilities of the instrument.",0
"The result of the reconstruction is shown as practical examples (rhythm samples, instrument playing positions, etc.), and it can be used to learn the play of the frame drum bubyns.",0
Master’s thesis research question is How Latvian seniors view their own aging and also the aging of others.,0
"Based on the theories of M. Foucault's discourse analysis and knowledge archaeology, the discourse on aging of Latvian seniors was researched.",0
Qualitative data were obtained from in-depth telephone interviews with twelve Latvian seniors.,0
The research paper illustrates how the aging discourse of Latvian seniors is largely constructed by various externally popular and stronger discourses.,0
"At the same time, the informants ""struggle"" with the consequences of external categorization and, to their surprise, even discover for themselves that nothing has changed so significantly in the reality of their lives that they should be included in another category of people.",0
Popular scientific literature is an engaging and accessible way for readers to get acquainted with science whilst maintaining scientific accuracy.,0
"In order for such texts to continue to fulfil their function through translation, the translation of scientific language in popular science should be examined.",0
This paper examines scientific language elements in Randall Munroe’s collection of popular scientific articles “What If?,0
Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions” as well as the most effective methods for translating and adapting it into Latvian.,0
"The translation of 2988 scientific language samples lead to a conclusion that terminology and syntax should mostly be translated directly or by loaning to accurately convey specific constructions and terms, but modulation should be used to improve fluency.",0
"Adaptation should be used rarely, as most scientific concepts are known cross-culturally.",0
The aim of this master’s thesis is to research the involvement and experiences of volunteers participating in sex offender resocialization project Circles of Support and Accountability (COSA) run by the State Probation Service.,0
"Given that the society generally holds critical and negative views of sex offenders, with this research I aim to identify reasons why volunteers apply for this task, what are their attitudes towards sex offenders, how they explain the causes of sex offences and which of the causes they can address.",0
The main findings suggest that volunteers are driven both by willingness to be useful for the society as well as a personal or professional interest.,0
"The social ecological model is used to identify how COSA functions in interpersonal, community and societal levels.",0

The study reveals women–writers’ attitude to the concept of Motherhood from the point of view of mother-daughter relations in a matrilineal narrative.,0
The analysis of both matrilineal narratives about three generations of women gives the opportunity to define the authors’ attempts to rethink a female history of each individual family.,0

"I study leadership through the lens of practices, looking at practices that shape the nature, direction, and change of the specific organization, and the relationships these practices are embedded in.",0
"I find that the most recurrent leadership practices in this organization are: ensuring connectedness among the members of the organization, keeping the organization alive and growing, and trying to influence societal change.",0
"These practices are related to and influenced by history, external actors, and core assumptions and ideas that people at Institut for (X) hold.",0
An overall conclusion is that leadership is largely about adaptation and change.,0

This research is intended to discuss the ideas and realities of this project from both the perspectives of economic and regional cooperation.,0
"In the first and second chapters, the author tries to explore the role of Cross-border Cooperation in the regional economy with the theory of New Economic Geography, and combines the existing examples of large cross-strait connection projects in the world as supporting evidence.",0
"On this basis, the third chapter introduces the theoretical significance of the construction of Talsinki Tunnel as well as the current proposals of the project, and analyzes the issues and controversies surrounding the tunnel project.",0
"It is concluded that the Baltic Tunnel between Tallinn and Helsinki should continue to be built to complement the transport system in the Baltic region, and the public management sectors, foreign investments, and private enterprises should develop innovative cooperation mode on this project.",0
"The title of the master's thesis is ""So close but still so far: the efforts of Russian entrepreneurs to integrate into the society of the Baltic States"".",0

Space is one of the most crucial categories of the human perception of the world.,0
"A common definition of space is unproblematic, in contrast to its theoretical explication.",0
"Until the 20th century, the concept of space has not been sufficiently studied, but with the Spatial Turn the situation has changed – space has become a cultural dimension, which allowed expanding the horizons of its study.",0
"Over the past decades, a large number of works have been devoted to the study of the concept of space, which proves its relevance to this day.",0

"None of them have been used as the only possible research method, but only in combination with the others.",0
To understand the historical conditions that influenced the creation and evolution of Thunder’s character the cultural heritage approach was used.,0
"Alongside this approach it was necessary to make a comparative textual analysis of Latvian and Lithuanian Thunder folklore, in which the elements of the comparative historical research method were used.",0
