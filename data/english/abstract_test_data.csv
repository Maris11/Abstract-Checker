58,"Master thesis “Volume and taxonomic composition of washed out macrophytic algae in the Latvia’s seashore of Baltic sea” was developed during summer and autumn seasons of 2018. Research was made in the Hydrobiology department of the University of Latvia, as a part of the EJZF project “Plan for the evaluation and managment of macroalgae rinse on the coast of Latvia” developed by the association “Baltijas krasti”. The aim of the paper is to identify the storage sites, distribution, taxonomic composition and seasonal dynamics of the rinsed macrophytes in the Vidzeme’s seashore, Kurzeme’s seashore and the open part of the Baltic Sea. In the Master's paper available literature on macroalgae growing in the Baltic Sea, morphological, physiological structure of algae, growth and reproduction conditions, described abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors affecting the Baltic Sea and macroalgae stands, identified sites of the development of rinsed macroalgae in the open part of Baltic Sea and the coast of the Gulf of Riga, viewed seasonal dynamics of macroalgae, defined taxonomic composition and developed recommendations for practical use of macrophytic algae. The Baltic Sea, with it’s specific hydro-meteorological conditions, provides the environment for the formation of bands of rinsed macroalgae. The formation of algal bands on the Latvian coast of the Baltic Sea is very uneven, depending on the season,coastal morphology and, above all, the frequency of storms. Individual areas are characterised by a complete shortage of rinsed algae. Maximum volume of rinsed macroalgae evaluated during autumn expedition in Liepaja, reaching 228.3 m3/100 m. In the open part of the Baltic Sea dominates red algae Furcellaria lumbricalis, in the Kurzeme’s seashore of the Gulf of Riga dominates brown algae Fucus vesiculosus, while in the Vidzeme’s coast of the Gulf of Riga, depending on the season, observed a relative balance between the brown algae Fucus vesiculosus and the generas of green algae - Cladophora spp. and Enteromorpha spp.. As sites for potential accumulation of rinsed macroalgae on the coast of the open part of the Baltic Sea – Liepaja and Pavilosta, Kurzeme’s seashore of the Gulf of Riga – Jaunkemeri, Melluzi and Lapmezciems, Vidzeme’s coast of the Gulf of Riga – Salacgriva and Saulkrasti.

60,"This work was made within the project of “Īpaši aizsargājamo kukaiņu sugu un to dzīvotņu inventarizācija biotopu direktīvā iekļauto sugu un Biotopu aizsardzības stāvokļa izvērtējuma kontekstā”, with a closer examination of saproxylic Hymenoptera in old and natural boreal forests and factors affecting their diversity. Insects were collected with the window trap method in 5 different landscapes. A total of 1391 specimen were collected consisting of 14 different families in the order Hymenoptera, and after evaluating morphological differences (except for the family Ichneumonidae),  88 morphospecies were distinguished. After evaluating different variable factors and insect diversity, it was concluded that the number of Hymenoptera in burnt forests was significantly higher than in non-burnt forests. Higher burn area, age of burns, forest age and thickness of tree bark did not have a significant impact on the number of Hymenoptera. The diameter of the tree affected numbers of Hymenoptera positively. Trees damaged more by burns had more morphospecies, but it had no correlation with the total number of Hymenoptera and Hymenoptera families. The number of Hymenoptera doesn’t change with the decay rate of the tree, but there is a visible tendency for dead and dry woods to have a slightly higher amount and diversity of Hymenoptera.",0
61,"Ticks act as vectors for a wide variety of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa leading to serious infection diseases in humans and animals. In Latvia, there are three epidemically significant tick species: Ixodes ricinus, Ixodus persulcatus and Dermacentor recticulatus. This study focused on employing molecular methods to identify tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia spp. in tick samples collected from biotopes and comparing prevalence regarding the aforementioned tick species.  In years 2017-2018, a total of 3494 ticks were collected and screened from biotopes from the five Latvian regions. The distribution of ticks species were characterized and the prevalence of pathogens were studied using a two-step polymerase chain reaction followed by employing positive amplicone sequencing in order to differentiate between the identified pathogen species. The amount of pathogens in the ticks were compared on the basis of the tick species, stage and sex. In total, 21.2% of ticks were pathogen-positive, while the co-infection was found in 1.4% of samples. The prevalence of pathogens was the highest in I. persulcatus (34.5%), and the lowest – in D. reticulatus. Borrelia spp. was the most prevalent infection, and all three Lyme disease species, namely B. afzelii, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi, were found. D. reticulatus distribution area has increased in Latvia, while the I. ricinus appeared to be the main vector for B. canis canis. The obtained results have showed a substantial risk for the tick-borne infection both for humans and animals, and the distribution of pathogens and vectors appeared to be a dynamic process in Latvian regions.",0
62,"Sand pink is protected by the European concil directive of the conservation of natural habitats, it is found in coastal dunes. Trampling and burial are factors that affect the vegetation in the coastal zone. The purpose of the work was to establish, under controlled conditions, the effects of sand accumulation and anthropogenic trampling on sand pink and how sand burial affects seedling.  Plants were distributed in nine different variants, combining trampling and burial factors. For seedling research four burial variants and one control group were distributed. It was concluded that both sand burial and trampling had a negative effect on the vitality of the plant, and even a small amount of sand did not protect the plant from mechanical damage. The optimal germination of the seed was up to 20 mm, at higher substrate acumulation, germination degrade rapidly.",0
63,"High bat mortality rates have been observed in wind parks during the autumn migration of bats. During this migration, a large number of bats migrate along the shoreline of the Baltic sea. To reduce bat mortality rates as much as possible, it is necessary to establish high risk zones, in which constructing new wind parks can’t be allowed, and it is also important to be able to predict the intensity of the autumn bat migration using meteorological factors.  During the time period from august 11th till august 25th in the University of Latvia Institute of Biology ornithology station in Pape, nightly bat passes were recorded in five different points with different distances from the sea. 74,6 % of all bat passes were recorded during the three most active migration nights, and 46,3 % of all bat passes were recorded at the dunes. Wind direction and speed had a significant impact on the bat migration.",0
64,"The comperative method is often used to verify the hypothesis that mating strategy and behaviour depends on the species habitat. In this method two taxonomically close species with different habitats are compared. The goal of this work is to inspect the differences in mating strategies of two Microtus hartingi subspecies, and its connection to subspecies formation in a fragmented area.   To measure the intensity of male care towards its offspring and female reproduction success in monogamous groups and polygynous groups with females who were relatives or unrelated with each other two M. hartingi subspecies were used: M. h. hartingi and M. h. lydius. Experiments were carried out in a laboratory setting. To measure the reproduction success 70 groups with male and female, 70 groups with male and two related females, and 22 groups with male and two unrelated females were made. To measure the male care of the litter 64 males were used: 32 M. h. hartingi and 32 M. h. lydius.  Results show that the most successful mating strategy for M. h. lydius is monogamy; there is no tendency to form communal groups. Males show high intensity of parental care, which is a characteristic of monogamous species. Whereas M. h. hartingi reproduce successfully in monogamous and polygynous groups; there is a tendency to form communal groups. The intensity of male parental care is lower than in M. h. lydius. The tendency to form communal groups for M. h. hartingi is related to subspecies formation and existence in a fragmented area.",0
65,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction and restricted, repetitive behavior. The causes of autism are multifactorial, and its aetiology is complex, with both environment and genetic factors playing a significant influence. According to the CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) 2014 data, ASD prevalence is 1 in 59 children in the United States. The estimated prevalence of ASD in children in Latvia, similarly to Europe, is 1 in 100. Currently, according to the medicinal literature there is no one therapy for the treatment of ASD symptoms. However, there are studies showing that with dietary changes, usually in combination with nutritional supplements, some ASD symptoms can be significantly decreased. The most commonly used diet for ASD is gluten-free, casein-free diet (GF/CF). The objective of the study was to investigate whether a low carbohydrate diet (SCD, Specific carbohydrate diet /GAPS, Gut and Psychology Syndrome diet), complemented with vitamins/supplements (vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, vitamin C, ascorbyl palmitate), could improve gastrointestinal  health in children with ASD, as well as, reduce some typical ASD symptoms. SCD/GAPS diet suggests avoiding sugar, grains, starchy vegetables, non-fermented milk products and processed food. This was a prospective case-control three-month intervention study that involved 10 children with ASD, who followed SDC/GAPS diet and used the abovementioned vitamins/supplements, as well as 7 children with ASD, who did not change their diet and, and this smaller group was used as a control group. Participants were 2 to 18 years old. The symptoms of children were evaluated 3 times during the study (in the beginning, middle, end of the study) using seven internationally validated questionnaires. The validation of these questionnaires in Latvian was performed during this study.  The study confirmed that SDS/GAPS diet, complemented with vitamins/minerals, can improve behaviour, reduce hyperactivity and sensory sensitivity, and improve speech perception/understanding and socialisation of children with ASD. In order to confirm these results, a larger study over a longer period of time would be necessary. SCD/GAPS diet and the use of recommended vitamins/supplements could be a safe and effective approach to help reduce some symptoms of children with ASD.",0
66,"The prevalence of gestational diabetes in the world is growing rapidly, affecting about 14% of all pregnant women. There are many risk factors for the development of gestational diabetes, and pregnancy itself contributes to the development of the disease, during which the insulin resistance increases ad cells are unable to fully use the glucose in blood for energy production. The change of lifestyle (nutritional habits, physical activity) plays an important role in reducing gestational diabetes and related complications. The aim of the research - to study the nutritional and physical activity habits of pregnant women with gestational diabetes. The design of the research - cross-sectional research involving 55 pregnant women and women one week after childbirth, where 21 of them had gestational diabetes (study group) and 34 were healthy pregnant women (control group). The selection of participants took place according to the principle of convenience, by carrying out a survey of pregnant women in the premises of Riga Maternity Hospital and in the private practice room of endocrinologist Spodrīte Keisa. The questionnaire “Nutrition habits of pregnant women in Latvia and its influencing factors” was used to clarify the habits of nutrition and physical activity. Results. In the group with gestational diabetes, the majority of pregnant women 71.4% (n = 15) indicate that they were overweight before pregnancy. Observing the readings from medical records for pregnant women with gestational diabetes during the first visit, the average BMI was increased by 28.35 (± 5.78) kg/m2. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes include more vegetables in their daily nutrition - an average of nine servings per week, however, in the pregnant control group - an average of six servings per week. 38.1% (n = 8) of pregnant women with gestational diabetes take the recommended exercise for 30 minutes, two to three times a week, while the same exercise is taken of 41.2% (n = 14) of pregnant women in the control group. Conclusions. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes most often do not choose to include porridge and breakfast cereals in their daily meals, and choose meat as the main source of protein. The most common choice for snacks is fruit and the rarest one - vegetables. The most frequent leisure activities are walking, cycling or other light physical activities.",0

68,"Master thesis title: Assessment of dietary habits, physical development and blood plasma biochemical parameters in junior school age children.  Background: Rapid increase of obesity in children and adolescents is alerting health problem. Regular measurements of weight and height, including body mass index (BMI) plotting on growth charts are important tools in monitoring children health and nutritional status. Early detection and treatment is likely to reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic diseases. The aim of the study is to evaluate dietary habits, physical fitness and blood plasma biochemical parameters in junior school age children according to the parameters characterizing the physical development of children.  Materials and methods. 96 children (age 9-10 years) from 13 schools in Latvia were enrolled in the study.  Anthropometric data and blood pressure were measured with standard procedures. Fitness level was determined by 3-minute step test. In order to find out children nutritional habits food frequency questionnaire was used. Children were divided into two groups: one group with overweight/obesity (N=32) and the second group with normal BMI/ underweight (N=64) based on World Health Organization BMI percentile scale. Nutritional habits and fitness level were compared between both groups. Triglyceride, high density lipoprotein and glucose levels were determined by E. Gulbis clinical laboratory. Estimated parameters using International Diabetes Federation criteria of metabolic syndrome in children were compared in both groups.  Results. There was a significant difference between the normal/underweight and overweight/obesity group in BMI, waist circumference, fitness level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose and triglyceride concentration. Three participants in overweight/obesity group have two International Diabetes Federation criteria of metabolic syndrome. Only 57.3% of participants eat breakfast every day, 24% eat fruits and 35.4% vegetables every day. In normal/underweight group participants eat more vegetables and drink more sweetened drinks. Conclusions: The primary results of the study provide a comprehensive analysis of children's dietary habits, blood plasma biochemical parameters, fitness level and physical development. The results suggest that children's dietary habits require significant adjustments to produce beneficial effects on children's physical development and regulation of blood plasma lipids and glucose homeostasis. Key words: dietary habits, physical development, blood plasma parameters, junior school age children.",0
69,"Sugar is a part of our daily diet. People like it, and it is being consumed in many ways – by adding it to tea or coffee, in sugar sweetened beverages, or many other products where it is added during the manufacturing process and it would be hard to imagine about. Sugar overconsumption is a general health problem of the population globally. The basis of concern about overconsumption of added sugars is excessive caloric load without any nutritional value, which leads to positive energy balance in diet. That may lead to progress of health problems like obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2.diabetes (WHO, 2015). Young people are the group of population who do not care much about their dietary habits. Consumption of fruit, vegetable and wholegrain is less likely than sweets and sugar sweetened beverages (Vilaro et.al., 2018). Also, the data show that level of knowledge and understanding is weak about healthy diet and place of sugar in it. But – as the knowledge is higher, the level of interest is also growing and the consumption of sugar is lower. The data obtained in our questionnaire show that understanding of added sugars is quite weak. Although, students are interested in their sugar consumption to maintain body weight or by health concerns, in most cases, added sugars are not recognized in the food labels. In about 50% of cases, sugar amount on the paper is not understood in real life. Anyway, students are interested in the topic and the idea of showing added sugars on the food label separately is evaluated positively as well as the use of mass media for educational purposes.",0
70,"Obesity is common risk factor for cardiovascular, metabolic and oncological diseases. Disease and obesity frequency is increasing, including children. Therefore it is important to find ways to early diagnose potential risks and prevent them. Purpose of the work is to evaluate hs-CRO (found in the blood serum test) connection with participants anthropometric parameters, physical activity and dietary habits. Methods. Participants of the study - 105 children (56.2% girls, 43.8% boys), age 9.5±0.5, average weight 35.1±9.1 kg, height 140.2±6.2 cm, waist circumference 60.7±8.0 cm. Blood serum was evaluated for hs-CRO, anthropometric parameters were measured, questionnaire about physical activity and nutrition habits, and physical activity test was completed. Results. Obesity was found in 30% of all participants. Hs-CRO was importantly higher in group with obesity. Hs-CRO statistically correlated with BMI, waist circumference and fitness level. BMI correlated with waist circumference, in the same time waist circumference increased in overweight children and those with lower physical activity. Relevance between dietary habits was not found. Conclusions. Hs-CRO is usable marker for cardiovascular diseases in children.",0
71,"In Latvia parvoviruses B19V, HBoV, hPARV4 are not sufficiently studied. There is some research that links encephalopathy and B19V, HBoV, hPARV4, although precise mechanisms of disease etiology are unknown. Parvoviruses are small Parvoviridae family members that have singlestranded DNS that is 5-6 kilobases long. These viruses don’t have an envelope, but only a capsid. The aim of this study was to analyse B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 possible role in pathogenesis of unspecified encephalopathy. Blood and plasma DNA from 28 patients with unspecified encephalopathy were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences. 6/28 (21,43%) patients were positive for B19V, 5/25 (20%) – for HBoV, none for hPARV4. DNA from blood and plasma samples of 7 patients with post-traumatic encephalopathy (control group) were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences. 4/7 (57,14%) were positive for HBoV, B19V and hPARV4 was not detected. Blood and brain tissue (also temporal and frontal lobe) DNA from 56 post-mortem individs were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences. 24/59 (43,86%) patients were positive for B19V, 3/24 (41,67%) – for HBoV, but 3/56 (5,36%) – for hPARV4. DNA from blood and brain tissue of 59 post-mortem individs without encephalopathy (control group) were tested for B19V, HBoV and hPARV4 genomic sequences. 18/59 (30,51%) of patients were positive for B19V, 6/25 (24%) – for HBoV and 2/59 (3,39%) – for hPARV4. To make general conclusion on involment of parvoviruses in the etiology/development of encephalopathy more analyses with increased sample size are needed.",0
72,"In this paper, HBcAg VLP packed RNA was analysed, depending on HBcAg expression plasmid used and their monomer or dimer form, chosen E. coli strains and cultivation medium. 12 different combinations of these parameters were analysed. Culture growth parameters (culture optical density and their specific HBcAg production) were examined, as well as VLP packed RNA fragment length and composition. For three experiment variants NGS RNA sequencing data analysis was performed. Results show, that all 12 of variants differ in VLP packed RNA quantity and composition, but further research is needed to thoroughly establish packaging differences between experiment variants. Several repetitions of experiment would also be helpful to prove regularity with good statistical significance.",0
73,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and CCL5 involvement in AIT development. This study included 60 AIT patients, 30 autopsied subjects without thyroid pathologies and 30 healthy donors as controls. HHV-6 genome sequence was detected in 59 (98%) AIT patients’ thyroid gland tissue and blood DNA samples and 23 (77%) in control group.  Active infection was detected in 35/59 (59%) AIT patients’ thyroid gland tissue. Higher median viral load was found in patients with active viral infection than in patients with latent infection (median 1206 IQR: 455-2804 active and 544.5 IQR: 155-1589 copies/1x106 cells latent infection). AIT patients’ RANTES level was statistically lower (median 9.267, IQR: 3.489-16.93)  compared to blood donors (median 56.6, IQR: 30.71 - 101.5) AIT patients who were positive for HHV-6 U12 and/or U51 gene expression, showed much lower RANTES level, compared to patients with active viral infection without the expression of U12 and U51 genes. RANTES and HHV-6 (gp116) was visualised in AIT patients’ tissue and blood, as well as control groups blood samples with immunohistochemistry. RANTES and was detected in control groups’ blood donor samples and AIT patient samples. HHV-6 gB (gp116) expression was detected in AIT patients’ PBMC samples, however RANTES expression was relatively low.",0
74,"During this study construction of expression plasmids containing sequences of the N-terminal hemaglutinin (HA) tagged melanocortin type 2 (MC2R) and type 4 (MC4R) receptors with fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the C-terminus was performed.The functional activity of these receptors was tested in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells and confirmed. Goal of this thesis was to use these receptors to measure the effects of the HA tagand the GFP on receptor membrane turnover by carrying out enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging accordingly. Due to technical complications the effects of GFP was not determined, but observed effect of the HA tag diminishes the possibilty of it. Statistically signigicant effect of HA tag was measured as it increased the MC2R surface expression, while it did not affect membrane turnover of MC4R. The stimulatory effect of the N-terminal HA tag exceeded the one of elevating the membrane turnover of MC2R associated protein (MRAP) in CHO cells. Tagging N-terminus with the HA peptide creates an artifact, because it abnormaly increases the membrane turnover of the MC2R, in this system it can not be used to characterise this parameter as in normal conditions.Methods for measuring membrane turnover using epitope tags should be validated with different techniques.",0
75,"Gene therapy is a powerful method for treating various genetic diseases and DNA vaccine development, yet, lack of safe and efficient DNA delivery methods still remains the limiting obstacle to human gene therapy. Various synthetic gene delivery agents that are safer than recombinant viruses have been developed, however, they do not possess the required efficacy. Dendrimers are type of synthetic delivery vehicles that exhibit several advantages over other delivery agents, and these nanoparticles have been investigated over past few years for in vitro and in vivo genetic material delivery. In this study, four different dendrimers – generation four poly(amidoamine) dendrimer PAMAM G4, generation four cationic phosphorous dendrimer CPD G4, generation four cationic phosphorous dendrimer AE2 G4 and generation two cationic carbosilane dendrimer CBD-CS G2, were studied to characterize their ability to interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and form dendrimer-pDNA complexes. Furthermore, in vitro transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity experiments were performed. Also, the ability of two dendrimers – CPD G4 and CBD-CS G2 – to introduce DNA in vivo in murine animal model was examined using bioluminescence imaging. The results of the biophysical characterization studies indicate that all four dendrimers efficiently bind pDNA and form stable complexes. Dendrimer CBD-CS G2 was the most efficient for cell transfection, and no significant cytotoxicity was observed. In vivo bioluminescence studies showed that CBD-CS G2 dendrimer is not an efficient genetic material delivery vehicle. In contrast, mice treated with pDNA complexed to increasing concentration of CPD G4 dendrimer, displayed bioluminescence in concentration dependent manner, and the highest photon flux was obtained in mice treated with 50 µg of CPD G4. These results indicate that phosphorous dendrimer CPD G4 is the most suitable one of the four investigated dendrimers for in vivo gene delivery, however, increase of transfection efficacy requires further optimization of DNA-dendrimer formulations.",0
76,"The yeasts are capable to synthesize aromatic compounds, therefore fermentation by yeast is an alternative method for the production of natural 2-phenylethanol.  The aim of this work was to investigate the use of yeast Kluyveromyces lactis in the biosynthesis of 2-phenylethanol in lactose containing medium. We determined the most suitable K. lactis strain for 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis, investigated the effect of medium composition on 2-PE production, dinamics of 2-PE synthesis during fermentation, K. lactis DSM 70799 2-phenylethanol tolerance, and two-phase extractive fermentation with rapeseed oil was performed.  In this work three industrially used K. lactis strains were used. From these strains K. lactis DSM 70799 produced the highest 2-phenylethanol concentration. The higher 2-PE concentration was obtained in lactose medium, therefore, as a substrate for the production of 2-phenylethanol, can be used lactose containing cheese whey and milk permeate. Phenylethanol is toxic to yeasts and inhibition of cell growth begins by adding 2,04 g/L of 2-PE. To reduce the toxicity and increase the amount of produced 2-PE, two-phase extractive fermentation with the addition of oil can be performed.  Methods mastered during the research: yeast cultivation methods, two-phase fermentation, biomass determination with spectrophotometer and multimode micro plate reader – incubator, determination of 2-PE with HPLC chromatograph and enzymatic determination of sugars.",0
77,"One of the cardio-metabolic diseases risk factors is weight, which is connected with high levels of fat mass, especially in abdominal region. Beside the anthropometry methods for cheaper and easier unhealthy metabolic weight diagnosis there is bioelectric impedance analysis methods popular. However, the preciseness of these methods is still debatable. Therefore the task was to evaluate the validity of the abdominal fat tissue bioimpidence analysis method in comparison to anthropometry methods. Total number of participants in research was 78 (48 women; 30 men).           To determine participants parameters for body tissue composition such methods as anthropometry and bioimpidence were used which entail: waist circumference, sagital abdominal diameter, total relative fat mass, abdominal and visceral fat level. In research it was concluded what it is necessary to use as many risk indicators as possible as well as their combinations when evaluating the health risks associated with obesity, as inclusion of one or more indicators in the assessment may lead to a misleading picture of the health risk.",0
78,"In this paper the information on the abilities of plant hyperaccumulation is summarized. The aim was to examine the possibility to use tallest stonecrop in research of heavy metal influence and uptake in controlled conditions and experimentally determine the accumulation of biogenic metals, - copper, zinc, manganese and sodium in plants, which were grown in the presence of different metal concentrations. To check the physiological reaction, chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured, in the end metal content in differerent parts of plants was determined. The results showed that the tallest stonecrop is able to effectively accumulate manganese and zinc in shoots, big amount of manganese was accumulated. Copper and sodium were accumulated too, but the plants’ growth and development was inhibited at the higher concentrations of sodium. Chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence in leaves also was influenced, but the plants were able to adapt. Tallest stonecrop is the potential candidate in phytoremediation.",0

80,"Fires are natural boreal forest ecology disturbances that change different forest ecosystem parameters and biological diversity, and in Natura 2000 site “Ādaži” that kind of disturbance is imitated using prescribed burning. In this research groundcover restoration after prescribed burning and fires was studied in dry scots pine forests of Ādaži by establishing plots and assessing species projective covers using Braun-Blanquet method. Species composition changes after prescribed burning and fire are similar, because in both cases after burning number of species increased which is explained by introduction of pioneer species which/whom dispersal mainly was by seeds. Most of species projective covers decreased after fires and that made open substrate and suitable conditions for sun-loving plants. Year after fires ground lichens disappeared and three years after fire they still haven’t regenerated.",0
81,"Bilberry is a dwarf shrub that is one of the most abundant species on ground vegetation in boreal forest ecosystems, however it is not enough valuated. It has a positive impact on species biological diversity and its presence is one of the indicators for enrichment in growing conditions (Bryant 1983). Similar to trees bilberry annual rings provide information about conditions in specific territory, nevertheless about shorter period of time (Schwingruber, Poschold 2005). Slitere national park and its surrounding was chosen as a study area because of the various aged Vacciniosa stands found in this territory. Also because of the forest fire which affected part of its territory. In total 21 plots (10 x 10 m) were made. Six of them were established in Vacciniosa young stands (13 – 21 years old), the rest of them were established in Vacciniosa stands with age ranging from 42 to 257 years. In each of the sampling plots five subplots were made based on specific scheme. In each subplot vegetation cover (%) and specie composition was determined. Diagonally three bilberry ramet samples were collected. Samples were processed in laboratory, measured the diameter, height and determined the age. DCA ordination analysis was used to determine differences in vegetation between sites. Generalized mixed linear model was made, to determine forest age influence on bilberry ramet parameters. This study finds that vegetation between different aged Vacciniosa stands do not differ. Whereas bilberry cover (%) differs and has a positive correlation with the stand age. Likewise forest stand age positively affects bilberry ramet parameters – diameter, height, age. Yet increased forest stand age decrease presence possibility of three to five year old bilberry ramets which have the most intensive formation of new clones. In young stands vegetation groups into two parts, respectively vegetation in burned and unburned stands. Significant differences in bilberry cover between both stand types were not observed. Master's Thesis was established in University of Latvia, Faculty of Biology, at the department of Botany and Ecology and in Latvian State Forest Research Institute “Silava” from May 2016 till May 2018.",0
82,"The aim of the research was testing a novel approach to find leading species in bird social groups – species, whose generated acoustic information (mobbing calls) are actively used by other participants of the group. The acoustic mobbing call recording and playback methods were used. Responses of members of wintering mixed-species bird flocks to the willow tit Poecile montanus and the crested tit Lophophanes cristatus mobbing calls were analyzed and discussed. Willow tits, crested tits, coal tits and nuthatches attended playbacks of mobbing calls. The results of this study show that the majority of the participants attended playbacks by willow tits. This suggests willow tit as the leadering species in the bird mixed-species groups.",0
83,"Resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy compounds is a significant problem in cancer treatment resulting in tumor regeneration and relapse. Chemoresistance can be mediated by various cell mechanisms, of which ATP binding casette (ABC) transporter overexpression is the most studied. Resistance often is mediated by selection of chemotherapy resistant subpopulations. Cancer stem cells (CSC) have the ability to avoid chemotherapy effects and to renew tumor cell population. The aim of this study was to determine ABC family gene expression and CSC characteristics in a doxorubicin resistant subpopulation of triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. After pulsed treatment with doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells higher ABC transporter gene transcriptomic expression of most ABC family genes tested both after exposure and the following passage was determined. Overexpression of several CSC marker genes was found, and also other CSC characteristics were identified – ability to renew cell population and higher colony formation ability. The restored population had higher resistance to doxorubicin, compared to control culture.",0
84,"Based on previously published research revealing the inner lighting significance on hole-nester occupancy in artificial nestboxes, a presumption was carried out, that the specimens of targeted species will choose brighter nestboxes over the darker ones. The target of the study was to reveal the role of artificial nestbox inner lighting level on the nest-site choice of Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca and Great Tit Parus major. In nature reserve “Garkalnes meži,” 152 nestboxes in 4 sample plots were prepared for the experiment by painting inner-hind walls of the nestboxes white, black and left unpainted (treatment). During the nesting season, nestbox occupation and internal lighting data were collected. In total, 32 Ficedula hypoleuca and 8 Parus major occupied nestboxes were observed. After carrying out dispersion and linear regression model analysis, the colour of inner-hind wall and level of internal lighting were determined as influential factors on nestbox occupation and nesting attempts. Results revealed that by the level of inner lighting nestboxes with white inner-hind walls are the brightest ones, black ones are the darkest and the unpainted (treatment) nestboxes are positioned in between. It was found out that the effect of nestbox defects on nestbox occupation is of negative statistical insignificance. Due to inssuficient amount of data it was not possible to determine nest-choice trends for Great Tits, for Pied Flycatchers a prefered choice of nestboxes with higher level of internal lighting was confirmed. Except in unpainted (treatment) group, occupation of nestboxes tends to increase along with increasing level of inner lighting. It was found out that occupation of nestboxes is insignificantly negative affected by nestbox defects.",0
85,"Death from breast cancer is usually associated with primary tumor’s ability to produce metastasis in other organs. For that, the cancer cells must be able to migrate and invade. Studies about extracellular Ca2+ concentration effect on breast cancer cell ability to migrate and invade are incosistent.

87,"In recent years the environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals has been increasing rapidly. This attracts the attention of researchers since these potentially bioactive compounds may significantly affect water quality and hydroecosystems as well as human health. Objective of the study is to determine toxicity of ibuprofen, acetaminophen (paracetamol), diclofenac, amoxicillin, ipidacrine hydrochloride, chloropyramine hydrochloride and sulpiride containing products using two biotesting methods: Daphnia magna acute toxicity test and algae growth inhibition test. During the work data on the inhibitory effect of pharmaceutical substances on aquatic organisms has been obtained. Sublethal concentrations – LC50 (concentrations that cause 50% death of test organisms) and effective medial concentration – EC50 (concentrations that cause 50% decline in physiological function of testorganisms) were found as well as sensitivity of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms were compared.  Experiment results show that commonly used products have medium to high toxicity. Pharmaceutical products which contain sulpiride (antidepressant), ipidacrine hydrochloride (NS stimulator) and chloropyramine hydrochloride (anti-allergic agent) have very high toxicity. Pharmaceuticals that enter water bodies may cause both crustacean and algae death especially in wastewater discharge spots of pharmaceutical factories.",0

98,"In vitro culture initiation and shoot rejuvenation from birches in their reproductive phase are difficult and often unsuccessful. To date, neither physiological nor molecular markers have been developed to evaluate the degree of juvenility of birch in vitro shoots, which could be used to track rejuvenation process and to determine factors affecting it. The study was carried out with the aim of finding out factors affecting in vitro rejuvenation of silver brich in vitro shoots and to develope physiological and molecular juvenility markers for birch in vitro shoots. The effect of subculture time, nitrogen amd sucrose concentration and different plant growth regulators on stabilized birch in vitro shoot rejuvenation were determined, using morphological, anatomical, physiological parameters as well as expression analysis of micro RNA (miRNA) 156 and their target genes was done. In addition effect of auxins and cytokinins on newly initiated birch in vitro shoots were detrmined It was shown, that suboptimal subculture time, increased nitrogen and sucrose level and increased auxin and cytokinin concentration promotes maturation of stabilized birch in vitro shoots, which is indicated by low morphogenic potential, elevated phloem width ratio to stem radius, developed periderm, increased polyphenoloxidase activity, as well as reduced level of miR156_511 and increased level of SPL1 expression. WPM, zeatin 0,5 mg L-1 medium and 30 day subculture time are the most optimal conditions for rejuvenation. MiR156 and its target genes SPL1 and SPL9 can be used as molecular birch juvenility markers, from which the greatest differences in expression levels between juvenile and mature birches are observed in miR156_511 and its target gene SPL1.

99,The aim of this research was to analyse spruce stump surface coverage with ‘Rotstop’ preparation and to examine impact of different concentration of P. gigantea preparations on development of fungi in conifer wood. Stump surface coverage is important to spruce stump treatment with P. gigantea. We investigated stump surface coverage with preparation and P. gigantea development depending on different diameter of holes in harvester guide bars. Stump treatment was made by four guide bars with different diameter holes drilled in it. Holes in the fifth guide bar were made by standard manufacturer. After a year samples were collected and analysed. There were no significant differences in area occupied by P. gigantea between treatments. P. gigantea development in spruce wood was low. Frequency of P. gigantea colonized stumps increased with increasing stump diameter.  Treatments with manufacturer’s recommended P. gigantea spore suspension concentration (5000 spores in mL-1) and reduced concentration (2500 and 1250 spores in mL 1) was applied in spruce and pine billets to evaluate reduced concentration effect on P. gigantea development and efficiency against Heterobasidion spp. Treatments in this study were carried out using local isolates of P. gigantea PG 323 and PG 286. In spruce wood treatments with twice reduced spore concentration were no significantly different from recommended concentration. Treatment with 1250 spores in mL-1 failed to control infection. In pine wood there was no significant decrease in efficiency in any of the treatments. In spruce wood isolate PG 323 was more effective .,0
100,"Women menstrual cycle influence physiological changes in organism organ system work and functions, for example, circulation, metabolism, thermoregulation. Scientific data about metabolic rate and it’s variation dynamics is inconsistent. That’s the reason why as a purpose for this study was to determine variation of metabolism and it’s parameters during menstrual cycle in young adult women.  In current study were participated 8 joung, clinically healthy woman in age from 20 to 34, with indirect calorimetry were determined gas changes data, which were used to determine resting metabolic rate and energy substrate - carbohydrates and lipids, oxidation rate during menstrual cycle.

102,"Apple is a commercially important horticultural crop around the world, but every year important losses are made by apple scab caused by fungal pathogen Venturia inaequalis. Apple scab management is mostly based on intense and regular use of pesticides, resulting with negative environmental impacts and negative impacts of human health. An alternative is to create scab resistant apple trees cultivars. It has already been observed that monogenic resistance to apple scab is not durable and it could be improved by including multiple resistance genes in one plant genotype or making gene pyramiding. The aim of the study was to evaluate and characterize Malus domestica (Malus × domestica) resistance against apple scab (causal agent Venturia inaequalis) heredity and the effectiveness of the selection process in hybrid families with different parental resistance. For this purpose, samples of 862 apple hybrids has been analyzed. Samples are divided into populations, depending on the resistance genes (Rvi6 and Rvi5) occurred in the parent genotype and their combinations (Rvi6 × susceptible variety; Rvi6 × Rvi6 and Rvi5 × Rvi5). Field scoring has been performed in 2016 and 2017. Scorings are made using the international VINQUEST apple scab assessment methodology, but the genes were identified by using specific and SSR markers. In parent genotyping 22 SSR molecular markers has been used.  There are only few studies that includes combined analyze of molecular and apple scab field resistance scoring data, although they can give more realistic pattern of resistance selection process. The study showed that the resistance of the apple scab in field is affected not only by resistance genes in genotype, but also the origin of apple cultivar, tree health status and resistance to other diseases. Apple scab resistance is determined by genetic factors, but the environment also has a modifying effect. The assessment of the heredity for resistance genes included in the breeding, it was found that the resistance genes Rvi6 (Vf) and Rvi5 (Vm) are inherited in accordance with Mendel's laws. The pyramiding of both genes in progeny discovered their separate inheritance. In general, the inheritance of both genes in progeny was not a main determining factor of apple field resistance tree, because the field's resistance to apple scab is influenced by a combination of several factors.",0
103,"Organic production is becoming more and more popular, when organic fertilizers are used for plant nutrition. One of advantages of organic fertilizers is rather high concentration of plant nutrients. However, there is a lack of knowledge on their influence on the growth, development and photosynthesis of different leafy vegetables and herbs. The aim of the investigation was to evaluate the influence of different concentration of vermicompost and compost on the yield and quality of leafy vegetables and herbs. Experiments were established at the premises of the Cathedra of Plant Physiology of the Faculty of Biology of Latvia University in the period from March 2017 to December 2017, where experiments on ten different leafy vegetables and herb species were conducted: rocket salad, basil, peppermint, spearmint, dragonhead, thyme, marjoram, rosemary, and valerian. Plants were grown in the pots where peat substrate or soil taken from organic field were used as substrate supplemented with different percentage per volume of compost or vermicompost. The measurement on plant morphological parameters were performed at the end of experiment to evaluate the influence of fertilization material and concentration on the plant development and growth. Electrical conductivity of substrate was measures at the beginning of growing season and harvest of plants. Starting with the 3rd week after plant transplanting in the growing substrate chlorophyll concentration and fluorescence of chlorophyll-α were measured. Dried plant samples were used for determination of ion concentration and electric conductivity. The aboveground mass of plants increases significantly in higher dosage of fertilization materials. Some species expressed sensitivity to increased fertilization rates with reduction of yield in comparison to control. It was found that vermicompost had better influence on the plant growth in comparison to compost. Also, chlorophyll formation in the plants was promoted in the variant with vermicompost fertilization. Fluorescence parameter Performance Index and Fv/Fo relative changes during the vegetation period varied between plant species, also depend of fertilization material and concentration. Ion concentration in the leaves increased by increasing fertilization dosage. Recommended fertilization dosage is 20 – 30 % of substrate volume.",0

105,"Organoclay is a material with antimicrobial properties and it has the potential to be used for protection against wood degrading fungi. This study examines the effect of two types of organoclay that contain trimethyloctadecylammonium chloride on Coniophora puteana and Trametes versicolor. Furthermore, the effectiveness to provide protection to birch plywood against wood-decay fungi with an organoclay additive in phenol-formaldehyde resin glue and impregnation film was also evaluated. The red organoclay had better inhibitory properties against wood-decay fungi than the white organoclay when added to a malt extract-agar medium. Based on the data from standards NF B 51-295 (bending strength test) and LVS ENV 12038:2002 (mass loss test), our results show that experimentally laminated plywood is more durable against wood-decay fungi than experimentally laminated plywood with an organoclay additive. It has been found that C. puteana degrades plywood more efficiently than T. versicolor. None of the four tested types of plywood was fully resistant against decay fungi due to their mass loss being greater than 3 %. Comparing samples with two different sizes for each of the standards, it was found that sample size affects the results. In conclusion, the results show that the organoclay additive in phenol-formaldehyde resin glue and impregnation film does not provide effective protection for birch plywood against white and brown rot fungi.",0
106,"Sea holly (Eryngium maritimum L.) and sea aster (Aster tripolium L.) are rare and endangered species, which are listed which is listed in Red Data Book of Latvia in the 1st category. Both species are remarkable for valuable natural substances with potential for use in pharmacology, cosmetics and the food industry. The aim of the work was to investigate the effects of different concentrations of sucrose and nitrate in the plant tissue culture medium on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in sea holly and sea aster. The hypothesis was that reduced nitrate concentration and increased sucrose concentration in the medium increase total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of extracts in shoot cultures. In the beginning  juvenile and homogeneous shoots were obtained by propagating them in media with 2.22 μM 6-benzylaminopurine for one month and after that cultivating them in MS medium without any hormonal supplements. Three concentrations of sucrose (40, 20and 10 g L-1) and three concentrations of MS salts containing nitrogen (25%; 50% and 75%) were used. Murashige and Skoog medium nitrogen containing salts were NH4NO3 and KNO3. Sea holly shoot cultures were cultivated for one to two months and sea aster shoot cultures were cultivated 2 months. After the period of cultivation, measurements were carried out to determine the content of the fresh weight, dry weight and chlorophyll content. Total phenolic content as gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per mg g-1 dry weight and the antioxidant activity expressed as Trolox equivalent in μM mg-1 of the dry weight were determined by spectrophotometry method. Reduced levels of MS nitrogen-containing salts and high, normal or reduced sucrose concentrations had no significant effect on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in both plant species. Sea aster had a slight tendency for higher  total phenolic content in media with 75% MS nitrate content but the difference was not statctically significant. Total phenolic content of sea holly shoots ranged from 16.03±1.69 to 18.14±1.10 mg g-1 GAE and the antioxidant content from 1517.0±63.84 to 1592±18.64 μM mg-1 Trolox equivalent but in sea aster shoots total phenolic content ranged from to 13.06±1.82 to 18.62±0.73 mg g-1 GAE and antioxidant content ranged from 1349±52.95 to 1471±88.96 μM mg-1 Trolox equivalent. Different concentratons of sucrose and nitrates had a significant effect on increase of fresh weight, the proportion of water in shoots and chlorophyll content of sea holly shoots, . These factors also had a significant effect on the content of chlorophyll in shoot leaves and water proportion in sea aster shoots.",0
107,"Even though sawyer beetles of Monochamus genus were considered as secondary pests before, their significance in Europe has increased after introduction of pine wood nematode Bursaphelencus xylophilus in Portugal in 1999, as this species vectors. B. xylophilus causes pine wilt disease, which kills large amount of trees. There is no data about occurrence of Monochamus genus and effectivity of pheromone traps in Latvia, which is an important information if there is a need to control B. xylophilus in future in risk zones – territories with higher chance of introduction of pests. The aim of this work is to find out occurrence of sawyer beetles of Monochamus genus in risk zones in Latvia and to evaluate effectivity of pheromone traps for catching conifer saproxylic beetles. The research was done in Latvia in pest risk zones.

108,"Lake Ilzas Geranimovas, it’s surveying history and evaluation of 2017 summer’s pankton ,especially Ceratium hirundinella, depending on abiotic factors and anthropogenic activity in different parts of the lake Lake Ilzas Geranimovas experiences long term environmental changes. For example, since 1952 temperature of lake’s hypolimnion has decreased by ~ 4,5 ⁰C while concentration of calcium has increased by 15 mg/l. Important anthropogenic impact is also present as both point and diffuse pollution. It has been historically shown that there is significant disparity of ecological quality of macrozoobenthos between different lake areas with worse being in southeast end of longitudinal lake. However, this study did not find such effect in planktonic communities, except of depressed density of cladocera group compared to the rest of the lake. Most significant differences were observed between two main parts of the lake – west and east, but those were explained by prevalence of large physical sections of deepwater (25 – 46 m) regions of lake, divided by significant relatively shallow (1 – 5 m) middle part. Results describing fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of Ceratium hirundinella showed statistically significant increase of FA in eastern basin, which was also the one with strongest theoreticized pollution influence. However, as FA analysis hasn’t been done in such a way this study describes, it should not be considered as objective argument without further studies. Key words: Lake Ilzas Geraņimovas, temperature of hypolimnion, anthropogenic pollution, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fluctuating asymmetry",0

285,"Quantum walk search is a search algorithm based on classical random walk, in which a marked vertex is sought in a structured database -- a graph. It is known that in many cases quantum walk can find the marked vertex in time $O(\sqrt{n})$, while classicaly $\Omega(n)$ time is required. If the quantum walk's starting state is roughly the same as a stationary state, the quantum algorithm does not achieve a better time complexity than the classical one. Thus the existance of stationary states, depending on the graph and marked vertices, is researched.  In this work we research quantum walk search using Grover's coin and its stationary states -- cases, where the walk leaves no impact on the state during its application.  A solution is known for the existance of stationary states in the case of all marked vertices forming one connected component and all unmarked vertices forming another connected component.

The proposed method not only eliminates the need for skin contact but also provides real-time images. This approach could offer a non-invasive, faster, and accurate diagnostic tool for skin diseases. Further experiments are required to validate the methodology for clinical use.",1
392,"This paper presents the development of a contrast sensitivity test method for chromatic modulation. The proposed method uses a computer-based platform to display a series of sinusoidal grating stimuli with varying contrast levels and chromaticities. Participants are asked to detect the presence of the grating pattern and adjust the contrast to a threshold level. The results of the study showed that the proposed contrast sensitivity test method was reliable and sensitive, providing a quantitative measure of chromatic contrast sensitivity. The method can be used to assess and monitor the visual function of individuals with various ophthalmic and neurologic conditions, as well as to evaluate the effects of visual training interventions on visual sensitivity.",1

397,"Within the last decade, replacing electronic components with photonic integrated circuits (PIC) has been proposed as a promising solution to the ever-growing demand for increasing data processing speeds. New materials with specific properties are required for manufacturing and development of these PICs. Organic materials are one class of materials that could potentially be used for PICs. However, for organic materials to fulfil the requirements of creating a photonic device, certain technological criteria must be met. In this work, the author takes a closer look at the physical processes governing one of the technological steps for processing an organic material suitable for PICs – chromophore poling in an external electric field. Second harmonic generation is used to investigate the dynamics and effectiveness of the poling process. Measurements are done on samples with parallel-plate electrodes for DMABI-PMMA guest-host systems of different concentrations, ranging from 1% to 16% by weight of DMABI. In this work, it is shown that there exist concentration-dependent electric field threshold values for second harmonic generation that can be explained by glass transition temperature and the molecular interactions of chromophore molecules in a given sample.",0

401,"The purpose of this Master’s paper was to investigate the rovibronic structure of 〖A^1∑〗_u^+ and  〖b 〗^3 Π_u state complex in Cs2 molecule using methods of Fourier transform spectroscopy and laser induced florescence. 〖A^1∑〗_u^+ and 〖b 〗^3 Π_u states are characterized by strong spin-orbital interaction, meaning that the states must be described as a single A~b complex.    Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker IFS-125HR) and various laser systems were used to acquire experimental spectra of the transitions between the A~b complex and the ground state in Cs2 molecule. This Master’s thesis includes the description of the methods used for analyzing the spectra.

404,"Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is found in natural conditions, most often in the form of sand and other minerals, but it is also actively synthesized in laboratories. There are differences in the artificially produced and natural SiO2, as it is possible to eliminate its natural imperfections by synthesizing SiO2. For example, the synthesis of SiO2 with fluorine or alkali impurities at different concentrations changes the physical, chemical and optical properties of the substance. The use of SiO2 in sectors such as optics, electronics, nanotechnologies, medicine, biochemistry, food chemistry demonstrates its extensive application.  SiO2  nanoparticles contain hydroxyl groups (-OH), which, when substituted with fluorine, increases lights permeability in UV and close IR range, resistance to radiation and decreases light refractive index. SiO2 particles whitch sintesyzed with alkali metals promots crystallization center emergence and decrease alloying temperature. Optical properties of SiO2 were identified with Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and photoluminescence.",0

However, compared to inorganic thermoelectric materials, polymer-based thermoelectric devices significantly lack the thermoelectric efficiency. In this work polymer based nanocomposites were modified with CNT’s coated with Bi2Se3 and Sb2Te3, well known n- and p-type thermoelectric materials with a narrow band gap and with topological insulator (TI) properties. Bi2Se3 and Sb2Te3 nanostructures were synthesised via catalyst-free vapour-solid deposition technique. The Bi2Se3/CNT and Sb2Te3/CNT heterostructures were then melt processed into PEDOT:PSS and PVA polymer matrices. The morphology of the heterosteructures and the nanocomposites was investigated using scanning electron microscopy as well as energy-dispersive X-ray analysis.

418,"The bachelors thesis is written on 30 pages. It contains 14 images, 3 attachments, 41 referenes to the literature. Aim of the thesis: To determine the quality of blinking and tear film on the higher order aberrations of the eye. Hypothesis of the tesis: The quality of the tear film has a high impact on making higher order aberrations – the more a person blinks and the worse the quality of the tear film is, the larger is growth of an higher order aberrations. Tasks of the thesis: 1.To determine the frequency of blinking and its impact on how fast the tear film breaks; 2.To measure the aberration scene and analyse its change between the 4 measurments; 3.To analyse the impact of frequency of blinking and the tear film quality on the change of higher order aberrations. Participants: 15 women in the age of 20 to 25 years participated. None of the participants are in the risk group of dry eye and in everyday life don’t use tear drops and therapies of medicaments. Method: There were 2 surveys fot the participants: „McMonnies” and „OSDI”, to assure that eyes are in good condition and that the participants are not in the risk group of dry eye. The frequency of blinking and the time of tear film breaking were scaled (TBUT – tear brake up time) with the invasive method. With the help of i.ProfilerPlus each participant was measured in 4 different time cathegories and scenes of the corneal higher order aberrations were scaled. Conclusions: In a time period of  10-12 seconds while the tear film is drying, the higher order aberrations increases from 0,19 to 1,74 µm, which corresponds to the determination of quality of tear film on complete function of optical system of the eye. A tear film in bad quality brings to a remarkable growth of optical system`s errors, which brings to weakening the quality of the vision from 0,25 up to 2,50 D. A more frequent blinking brings a faster drought of the tear film, which means that the growth of aberration is higher in a shorter time period. If the blinking frequency is lower and the quality of tear film is higher, the impact of aberration on the maintance of vision decreases",0

446,"Observations of the interstellar medium show that in cold conditions (T~10 K) a coat of ice around interstellar dust cores forms from surrounding gas. This coat of ice can be chemically differentiated two parts: surface and mantle. This icy surface an mantle allows complex molecules to form in the interstellar medium. Models for dust grain mantle reactions and diffusion need to be developed for the simulation of chemical kinetics, because of new spectroscopic data coming about the formation of complex molecules with the help of interstellar grain mantle processes. It is well known that interstellar dust grains consist of a small amount of molecules compared to the interstellar gas. Therefore, the effect of reagent fluctuation in the interstellar grains needs to be taken into account when considering the chemical kinetics of the interstellar medium. In this thesis, a macroscopic model for interstellar ice mantle diffusion and mantle reactions is developed. The reactions are simulated with Gillespie’s algorithm, which models reactions as Markov chain processes and takes into account the fluctuation of reaction reagents. This approach allows a larger reaction network and more reagents to be included in the simulation than other microscopic approaches. The physical conditions of a cold collapsing translucent molecular cloud, which collapses to a cold dark cloud, are considered. These conditions are important in understanding the chemical development stages of protostars. The calculations in this thesis show that the model describes the growth of the ice mantle pretty well, but the evaluated reaction rates for mantle photodissociation are estimated too high in the model.  In conclusion, this model is a step in the positive direction in developing a macroscopic approach for diffusion and reaction in the ice mantle.",0

522,"City can be seen as multifunction organism, which is able to function due to both internal recourses of the urban ecosystem and is even more dependent on external recourses. Nevertheless rising population numbers and pressure on the nature areas and cultural heritage sites is constantly increasing. Urban management and administration is based on rigid legislation instruments and technical engineering solutions. Consequently cities become rigorous and human-controlled systems that lose the ability to adopt to unpredictable external factors. The loss of city’s cultural and historical face leaves an undesirable mark on place identity and well - being issues. This research focuses on urban green infrastructure restoration and integration in the surrounding landscape, taking into consideration social and cultural heritage issues. Additionally, this work will research various case studies that could serve as an additional source of data not only to complement theoretical background overview but also integrate practical examples into research results by providing recommendations for urban green infrastructure planning. Each anthropogenic intervention leaves a stamp on the landscape that makes it almost impossible to reverse system to the previous system state. For this reason the research is based on social-ecological system sustainability (resilience) assessment which examines the issues of the particular system, its key components, system dynamic in various scales and also governance and social network characteristics.

534,"The master’s thesis “Plastic Waste Recycling and the Provision Thereof in Latvia” analyses plastic waste management in Latvia, the aims thereof on the scale of the European Union, as well as the final status requirements for plastic waste. By carrying out the analysis of national guidelines for polymer waste recycling, the author has compared EU recycling requirements with the practical possibilities of recycling. During the research, the author visited the PET recycling company “PET Baltija” in Jelgava and the municipal waste sorting station and polygon “Brašķi” in Līvbērze Parish. The author analysed the process of waste collection in Latvia, as well as the import of waste from abroad, thus identifying currently existing problems and offering solutions. In Latvia, plastic waste is mainly recycled by “PET Baltija” who work with PET bottles and by “Nordic Plast” who work with film and various polymers (Eco Baltia 2014). Having visited waste recycling companies, as well as having studied the industry and inspected the best EU practices, the author has analysed and suggested what type of polymers could be additionally recycled in Latvia and what type of impact the changes would have on the environment and the economy. The paper comprises conclusions that are based on specific measurements and the examination of practical recycling technologies. The master’s thesis includes an overview and analysis of waste collection and sorting examples from abroad, as well as suggestions for waste management improvements in Latvia. One of the main points for ensuring quality plastic recycling is the sorting of plastic waste by type after the collection thereof. The paper identifies various types of household waste and inspects what type of plastic waste and in what amount a household generates over a specific period of time, also establishing what type of polymers are the most common ones. The quantity of each type of plastic was determined by sorting and weighing. The master’s thesis includes an analysis of plastic packaging that forms the largest part of plastic waste on a daily basis. Plastic packaging consists of the following types of polymers and marking: polyethylene terephthalate – PET 1; high-density polyethylene – HDPE 2; polyvinyl chloride – PVC 3; low-density polyethylene – LDPE 4; polypropylene – PP 5; polystyrene – PS 6; and other polymers – 7 (Plastmasa 2009).

537,"According to the latest research on climate change in Europe, air temperature is predicted to increase. It is expected that the higher summer temperatures will affect the quality of life of people in cities, as well as the demand for refreshments. As urbanization develops, urban areas become complex network systems with a specific structure and increased human activity. Environmental changes and developments always affect the microclimate. In turn, climate change can have various effects on the environment and citizens, such as the impact on health, increased energy consumption in buildings, changing understanding of vegetation and landscape design. In order to understand the city's microclimate, it is important to look at the type of building and its characteristics, as well as the meteorological parameters. One of the factors that irrevocably changes and is very important for a person's well-being is the thermal comfort. It is well known that it is possible to build a climate-appropriate design, reducing the heat stress at street level and energy consumption, resulting in a positive effect on health, social, economic and environmental aspects. Spatial and temporal characterization of thermal comfort characterization indicators is described in the Master's thesis using mathematical modeling methods. The pilot area was chosen for the research - densely built city center district of Riga (Raina Boulevard 19), surrounded by a square.

551,"Marine litter (ML) is mainly the consequence of economic or non-economic activity of human beings. In order to reduce the amount of litter that ends up in the ocean, social litter-related habits should be shifted to principles based on circular economy. For the purpose of applying effective actions to reduce ML, the sources, causes, impacts, and future trends of ML should be fully understood.  The aim of the Bachelor thesis is to identify the potential ML sources and hazards of the Blue Flag program municipalities, to analyse the results obtained in order to apply effective actions that minimize the threat of litter occurring in coastal areas and ending up in the sea. Although the Blue Flag program municipalities already have good environmental management solutions in place, the data gathered by My Sea (Mana jūra) campaign show that the number of units of litter on the Blue Flag beaches is equal or even higher than the Latvian average. The thesis sheds light on actions with a number of sources that reduces the ML hazards. If municipalities were motivated to ensure high standards of good sea environment and beaches to its inhabitants and beach-goers, it would consequently reduce the hazards of emergence of new ML.

631,"The topic of this bachelor’s thesis is “North Korean Totalitarian Regime. Determined to Survive.” Nowadays, the issue of North Korea is being discussed and debated more and more often. Until the 1970s, North Korea was much more economically developed than South Korea, but in the 1990s, Kim Ilsong’s carefully designed and built system began to collapse. The US government and many researchers and observers predicted that the North Korean regime would not survive and collapse in the near future, but, despite all problems, it still remains in force and poses a threat to other countries, while other similar regimes either changed out of recognition or collapsed. The emphasis in this paper is on the internal analysis of the regime and the study of internal political tools and instruments used by the North Korean government to ensure its power in the country, the internal stability and continuing survival of the regime against all the obstacles that it constantly faces.  The thesis is divided into two main parts. The first part provides an insight into the origins of North Korea's totalitarian regime, as well as the main features of totalitarianism. The second part examines and explores the methods and tools used by the North Korean government to secure its totalitarian power in the country. It also takes a closer look at the period from the 1990s to the present, in order to trace changes in government measures to maintain power in the wake of North Korea's rapid economic downturn and the collapse of the original political control system. It was concluded that although the regime had lost initial control over society and society’s faith, it managed to subordinate the population and ensure stability by increasing repression and militarization of the state. The regime remains to be at the totalitarian stage and ensures hegemony over society, thus, the internal stability of the regime is assured and the economic crisis has not led to its collapse.

640,"The topic of this thesis ir “The Effect of Hanja on Emotional Overtones of Korean Language Words”.  Understanding of emotional overtones of words is important to successfully communicate and understand the language. It is influenced by several factors, for example, the culture in which the language developed, also the communicators personal system of values, education, ethnicity. The goal of this theses is related to korean language word morphology and its influence on emotional overtones. That’s why in this thesis, it was studied how Chinese language characters or hanja affect emotional overtones of Korean language words. Approximately 65% of Korean language words are of sino-korean origin meaning they are borrowed from Chinese language or made using chinese characters.  Hanja historically has had a huge impact on Korean language so understanding it can boost learning of Korean language.  Analysing Korean language words whose first syllable is one of chosen negative hanja characters it was concluded that even though there are cases when these words have positive emotional overtones however mostly these words have negative emotional overtones. While Korean language words which start with one of hanja characters, whose meaning is positive values, have a tendency to reflect this meaning of the first syllable and these words are mostly with positive emotional overtones.  This thesis is divided in three parts and each part has 2-4 chapters. The first part looks into the theory of emotional overtones both in general and in relation to Korean language. And also at the history of hanja and hangul, putting emphasis on the importance of hanja and its impact on Korean language. The second and third part of the thesis are devoted to word analysis.

650,"Bachelor’s thesis “Elements of Taoism in Acupuncture” is devoted to the beginnings of Chinese healing, the explanation of Taoism and acupuncture as a part of Taoism. The main topic of the paper is: the concept of Taoism in acupuncture.  Taoism is a system of faith and philosophy that can be regarded as one of the foundations of Chinese culture. Taoism has emerged circa IV-III centuries B.C., however taoism is also closely associated with more ancient beliefs - the theory of holism, alchemy, etc. It cannot be denied that, in such a long period of time, the Chinese cultural heritage is permeated with elements of Taoism. Chinese traditional medicine had evolved under the strong influence of Taoism, formulating its own characteristic view of therapeutic methods. Nowadays acupuncture still remains an actual topic. In the world, there are always cases when doctors, for different reasons, recommend to use traditional medicine remedies and methods, rather than those of conventional modern medicine. In modern era of globalization, interest in traditional medicine methods, including acupuncture, is growing not only in China, but also elsewhere throughout the world.  The aim of this work is not to dispel the criticism of the traditional medicine methods of treatment, but to consider traditional Chinese medicine as an important aspect of culture, which, in particular, was influenced by Taoism.  The first part serves as an introduction to Taoism and a brief description of main concepts behind it. The paramount concept of Taoism is tao - the path, source and principle of the cosmic order, the flow of vitality. De often refers to the activity that is manifested in the tao. The third guiding principle is wuwei, which could be interpreted as “For everything it is necessary to understand when to stay passive”. The second part of this thesis is focused primarily on analysis of the theories of traditional Chinese medicine, such as:  holism, the five element, the qi energy, xue, yin-yang, and zang-fu theories.  The closing, third, part is devoted to method of acupuncture and its analysis. Acupuncture began to take shape more than 2500 years ago and was constantly evolving since. The methods of acupuncture are based on acupuncture point – “acupoint” activation with a needle. In a broad perspective, Chinese acupuncture treatment aims to unblock the meridians (jingluo) - channel network through which the life-energy known as ""qi"" flows, increase blood circulation and qi energy flow, as well as harmonize the yin and yang elements.",0

659,"Collaboration is an important part of education. One of the most widely praised and studied collaborative learning approaches is collaborative writing which is often used in language courses. Academic writing is an integral part of higher education and developing academic literacy skills is crucial in ensuring successful academic performance. Although the importance of academic literacy is undeniable, there is limited research available on the influence of collaborative writing on students’ academic literacy. Therefore, the goal of the present research is to explore the effectiveness of collaborative writing in academic literacy development. To reach the goal, a case study was conducted, involving an experiment and a questionnaire. The participants of the study were 12 first-year undergraduate English philology students. During the experiment, students individually and collaboratively produced comparison/contrast paragraphs. The analysis of the student paragraphs revealed that collaborative writing is an effective activity when it comes to producing texts of higher formality as well as in constructing proper paragraph structures. However, it showed little effectiveness in increasing the lexical density or length of a paragraph. The results of the questionnaire suggest that students have an overall positive attitude towards collaborative writing. The findings of the study lead to a conclusion that collaborative writing is effective in improving some aspects of academic literacy, while ineffective in improving others.",0

663,"This thesis addresses the contradictions within individual Zero Waste consumption practice. For theoretical framework, I have chosen Kathryn Wheeler's (2017) three-layer framework for 'moral economy' in the context of consumption. Since Wheeler's framework does not provide precise definition of 'moral', I have added Zigon's (2017) 'moral breakdown' and 'ethical demand' analytical approach to the framework. Methods used in order to carry out the research was participant observation, state regulation analysis, social media ethnography, informal and unstructured interviews. I argue that the willingness to participate in Zero Waste practices is rooted in different kinds of moments of ‘moral breakdown’ connected to consumption. Zero Waste it is perceived as the most convenient way to address the ‘ethical demand’ that is placed on consumption practices.",0

In this study a broader understanding of health care systems is demonstrated by employing A. Kleinman’s theoretical perspective. Kleinman’s explanatory model is used both as a theoretical and methodological approach. Main data collection methods are in-depth, semi structured interviews and text and visual material analysis. To interpret empirical data, explanatory model approach is adapted by contextualising it in the postsocialist perspective. This study reveals that depression patients experience depression as a loss of control, thus their help seeking activities are organised to regain their ability to manage their lives.",0

Member states may impose additional requirements on these professions. Such professions also include lawyers and notaries. Conditions imposed by the member states, may interfere fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Therefore, it is important that these conditions are non-discriminatory and based on objective considerations. As the requirements imposed by the member states may differ, it is necessary to have a regulation that allows citizens from other countries to work there as well. The European Union has developed secondary legislation that helps to even differences of the qualifications. Nowadays the role of professional mobility is growing and it is even more important to have an effective regulation of professional qualifications.

768,"Contribution in kind (property contribution/investment) is one of the way of paying for the share capital of a capital company. The amount of the share capital of a company is always expressed in cash, but payment in cash is only one of the methods of payment of the share capital. Contribution in kind is not money in itself, therefore, in order to invest it in share capital, it is necessary to determine the value of property investment, in accordance with Sections 151 and 153 of the Commercial Law (Corporate Law). To determine the value, a valuation professional-certified evaluator is required. There are also exceptions when the founders of a company may also provide a conclusion on the valuation of property investment. Standards have been established for the valuation of assets, methods and requirements, which determine the criteria and procedures for determining the value of given assets. The certified evaluator is also subject to certain criteria, both for obtaining a certificate and for drafting a property investment appraisal conclusion. Valuation of a contribution in kind is subject to the requirements of several regulatory enactments and standards, if these regulatory enactments have been violated, the persons who have performed the valuation of the contribution in kind shall be liable for losses incurred in connection with an incorrect or unreasonable conclusion. However, in practice the value of the subject of the contribution in kind may change, thus the incorrectness of the assessment may be unambiguously established. The opinion on the valuation of the contribution in kind shall be valid for six months from the date of its preparation. In practice, there have been cases where different assessments have been made for the same asset, performed by different evaluators.

873,"Background  Up to this day, there is no collected and analyzed data on the incidence of allergic and non-allergic asthma in Latvia. This study will examine information on the gender and age-specific incidence of allergic and non-allergic asthma and correlation with other parametrs such as BMI and smoking. Objective  To determine and calculate the incidence of allergic and non-allergic asthma in Latvia between different sexes and age groups. Methods  For development of research we used P. Stradins Clinical University Hospital Lung disease and thoracic surgery center diagnostic laboratory database. Database contained information about BP test results performed during the period of three years. Data was collected on 2417 patients who had undergone BP testing for pulmonary function measures, evaluation of the therapy efficiency or bronchial asthma diagnosis.  Results  Results of research shows that negative outcomes from BP testing is more often – 63%, than positive cases – 37%. Analyzing BP tests between the genders, we found that positive and negative test outcomes are common for both - women and men, but with the increase in age, the result of a positive test is dominated by women in the age group of 51-70 years (p=0,0307). The results of the positive BP test were summarized and grouped according to the BA form. Allergic asthma was detected in 8.9% cases, but the number of patients with non-allergic asthma was 3 times higher - 28.1%, from which we conclude that the predominant form of asthma is non-allergic asthma. The highest incidence of non-allergic (5,5%) asthma is observed in women aged 51 – 70. The number of cases of non-allergic asthma in women increases with age. Analyzing correlation between allergic and non-allergic asthma and BMI we found that increased BMI predominates in the non-allergic asthma and prevails mostly among women (p=0,00341). Increased bronchial reactivity and a positive BP test were statistically more common in smokers (p=0,00020). The predominant form of BA in smokers is non-allergic asthma. Conclusions  The obtained data show that non-allergic asthma predominates in adults. In women, unlike men, the incidence of non-allergic asthma increases with age, culminating in age 51-70. Increased BMI predominates in the non-allergic asthma and prevails mostly among women. Non-allergic asthma is more common in smokers than allergic asthma.",0
874,"Aptamers are a modern drug form with a very high potential. It can be used in diagnostics, as a drug itself (agonist or an antagonist) or it can be used as a drug delivery tool. Methods that are used to acquire and to also study aptamers are very diverse and still are being improved, because it has many steps between – starting with just a random sequence library and ending with the actual end sequence which in the end can be called an aptamer. These steps can be modified and adjusted to get the sequence that is wanted. Particularly interesting is data processing by which only a couple out of million sequences are filtered out that have the wanted specific characteristics, such as a high specificity against the target, high affinity with the target, structural stability and other specific features that make aptamers a very favorable and promising potential drug class.

885,"Schizophrenia is one of the most common psychiatric syndromes in the world, with, about, 1.1% people affected. No one knows the exact mechanism of the disease and it is uncurable. Taking into consideration how little people are informed about schizophrenia it creates prejudice and ignorance in people, often resulting in people with schizophrenia being rejected from society. Usually these fears are created because, we as a society do not know enough about the syndrome. Mostly, people with schizophrenia get treated with the pharmacological method, which effectively suppresses and treats schizophrenic symptoms. But, because most of the anti-psychotic drug side effects are sedation, people with schizophrenia struggle to do day to day activities and keep up any kind of energy.  The aim of this research was to evaluate awareness of Latvian residents and pharmacists about schizophrenia and therapeutic opportunities for people with schizophrenia in Latvia. To explain the results, not only literature was used but a survey was made, that 411 people filled out. The results indicate that Latvian citizens and pharmacists are mostly informed about the syndrome and its symptoms, and they want to see more information amongst the public about schizophrenia.",0
886,"The aim of this research was to evaluate therapeutic challenges of trigeminal neuralgia in Latvia. To explain the results, not only literature was explored but also two neurologists and a dental surgeon were interviewed, to find out what therapy they use and how often do they meet patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Also, the analysis of outpatient cards of patients with diagnosed trigeminal neuralgia, for the past three years, was performed, taking information from Jelgava Hospital and Pauls Stradiņš Clinical University Hospital. The results show that in Latvia people in age range from 50 – 60 years old are mostly diagnosed with TN, and for the most part its women that are affected. To confirm the diagnosis we can see that CT cerebri is used as a diagnostical tool, but European guidelines clearly state that MR should be applied to every person who exhibits signs of TN. Medications for the most part are half anti – convulsants and half pain killers for primary therapy, which again does not match the European guidelines for TN management.",0

891,"Background: Child mortality in two of the three Baltic states have been historically high for EU standards. Previous research suggests there may be economic factors contributing to this. The primary objective of this study is to expand on the previous research by investigating the relationship between rates of mortality stratified by age groups; Perinatal, Neonatal, Infant, Under-five and Youth (5 - 14) the Baltic states; Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania with their corresponding macroeconomic indicators. By analysing a time period mindful of recent economic history, from 2008 to 2018, it allows us to see in detail the effects, if any, that the global financial crisis had on child mortality in the region.  Methods: Statistical data was gathered from national and international databases for rates of child mortality and macroeconomic Indicators. This data was then analysed using a multivariate regression analysis in SPSS.  Results: Statistically significant correlations were found between Total GDP and GDP per capita for under-five and youth (5 - 14) mortality for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Additionally, an association was found between Healthcare expenditure and Neonatal, Under-five and Youth mortality in Estonia, and Under-five mortality in Latvia. Moreover, an association was uncovered between rate of unemployment and the Under-five and Youth mortality mortalities in Lithuania. No further associations were found.  Conclusion: The mortality of children between the ages of 1 – 14 is tied to the economic stability of the Baltic states. Furthermore, Estonian health care spending policies are responsible, at least partially for the low levels of mortality recorded in Estonia. If similarly effective policies were to be applied, comparably low rates of child mortality could be achieved across the Baltics States.",0
892,"Background: Although vascular anatomy is widely described and seemingly clearly defined in both the anatomical and surgical literature, available scientific publications show that vascular variations, including disparate carotid bifurcation localizations and external carotid artery branch variations, are very common. For this reason, in the opinion of the author, it is important to analyze the most common types of vessel variations of the head and neck; the bifurcations of the common carotid artery, as well as three important branches of the external carotid artery, the superior thyroid a., the lingual a., and the facial a., including three-dimensional mapping of their anatomical variations. Aim of the work: To perform three-dimensional mapping of the common carotid bifurcations and the exterior carotid group branches relative to axial skeletal landmarks. Methods and materials: Computed tomography angiography of the brachiocephalic blood vessels of 28 patients was performed and the location of the carotid artery bifurcation and external carotid artery ventral group branches in relation to axial skeletal landmarks was determined. Results and conclusions: 1.The bifurcation of the carotid artery was on average 0.22 ± 9.23 (SD) mm above the upper terminal plate of the fourth cervical vertebra, 2.the superior thyroid a. branched on average 1.87 ± 4.36 mm above the common carotid artery bifurcation, but the left thyroid a. branched 1.61 ±3.12 mm  below the total bifurcation of the carotid artery. The right lingual a. branched an average of 13.77 ±8.01 mm but the left lingual a. averaged 13.63 ±7.90 mm above the bifurcation of the carotid artery, while the right facial a. branched an average of 20.00 ±7.59 mm, but the left facial a. averaged 21.52 ±8.24  mm above the carotid artery bifurcation. 3.Anatomical variation of the linguofacial trunk was observed in 14 patients (50%) (8 patients unilateral; 6 bilateral), while unilateral truncus thyrolinguofacialis was identified in one patient (0.03%). The right linguofacial trunk branched on average 23.97 ±6.56 mm while the left linguofacial trunk averaged 19.64 ±5.67 mm above the common carotid artery bifurcation, while truncus thyrolinguofacialis branched 22.30 mm above the common carotid artery bifurcation",0
893,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by quantitative and qualitative changes that occur within the intestinal microbiota. Glucose and lactulose breath tests are generally accepted standard to diagnose SIBO. The North-American and European guidelines for breath testing set out different diagnostic approaches and lack guiding principles in several practical situations, i.e. no guidelines are provided as to how to interpret initially high H2 and CH4 concentrations. Aim: To find out mutual correlation of the results of glucose and lactulose breath tests by applying the diagnostic criteria set out in the North-American breath testing guidelines, to elaborate recommnedations to improve methodological approaches of breath testing.  Objectives: To analyse and systematize breath H2 and CH4 concentrations of participants involved in the study. To determine correlation between a positive test result and gastrointestinal symptoms reported during breath testing, and between gastrointestinal symptoms during breath testing and the gender.  Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of participants with abdominal symptoms who underwent breath testing in Digestive Disease Centre “Gastro” from 2015 till 2019 was performed.  Every participant underwent lactulose and glucose breath tests. The North-American criteria to define SIBO positive subjects were applied. Reported symptoms during the breath testing period were analysed. Results: The study cohort  was composed of 60 participants (50% male) with median age of 42 years. 41.7% (n=25) and 13.3% (n=8) of patients were diagnosed SIBO positive with lactulose and glucose test, respectively. 6.67% (n=4) tested positive with both breath tests. Correlation of negative testing results was 51.7% (n=31). 36.7% (n=22) demonstrated elevated (≥ 16 parts per million) initial H2 concentrations. High H2 concentrations were maintained in 45.5% (n=10) and 13.6% (n=3) in those with initially elevated concentrations in lactulose and glucose breath tests, respectively. CH4 producers accounted for 16.7% (n=10) of the cohort. 20% (n=12) reported symptoms during lactulose test and 28.3% (n=17) during glucose test. Bloating was the most common symptom reported in both breath tests. Statistically significant correlation between bloating and the positive result of a breath as well as between frequency of symptoms and the gender was not observed (p> 0.05). Conclusions: Differences exist between the glucose and the lactulose breath test results. In clinical practice doing both breath tests for each patient is recommended. Breath H2 and CH4 concentrations should be analysed. The study sets out recommendations to solve the problem of interpretation of initially elevated breath gases.",0
894,"The importance of work: Rosacea is a common dermatosis, affecting approximetely 22% of the European race. Association of rosacea with increased risk linked to other morbidities has been proven, being based on similar pathogenic mechanism of the ER stress. A broader insight of this has emerged only in the last decade. The metabolic syndrome is a complex of metabolic disturbances, including a set of cardiometabolic risk factors, and is known to be linked with higher risk acquiring other morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and insuline resistance is rapidly increasing. The possible connection of glycation and rosacea has never been researched and is analyzed for the first. The purpose of the research: Research the clinical manifastations of rosacea in patients with metabolic syndrome, insuline resistance and glycation.  Methods and materials:  Data of  “Veselības centrs 4” subsidiary “Dermatoloģijas klīnika” patients have been used in a prospective one center study. The data were obtained during the visit after the patient’s voluntary consent. All data were summerized using MS Excel, and IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 was used for the analysis of data. Results and conclusions: 1.The incidence of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance was significantly more frequent in rosacea patient group comparing to control group (Pχ = 1,56 x10-2, V = 0,38). 2.The severity of rosacea was not statistically significantly associated with metabolic syndrome (Pχ = 0,37) and insulin resistance (Pχ = 0,43). 3.Rosacea patient group was statistically significantly more likely to be overweight or obese (Pχ = 1,13 x10-4, V = 0,61), statistically significantly more likely to have increased waist circumference (Pχ = 5,26 x10-3, V = 0,42), and statistically significantly more likely to have arterial hypertension (Pχ = 1,24 x10-3, V = 0,46) than the control group. However, there were no statistically significat differences in HDL - cholesterol levels (Pχ = 0,753), no statistically significant differences in triglyceride levels (Pχ = 0,32) and no statistically significant differences in glucose levels (Pχ = 0,64), comparing to the control group. 4.Rosacea pateint and control groups did not statistically significantly differ in AGE reader values (PMV = 0,40).",0
895,"Dyslipidemia and obesity are significant risk factors which do not get enough attention in our society. Dyslipidemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular risk, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is a chronic liver disease that can progress into liver cirrhosis. The liver is the major source of cholesterol and other lipids in the body. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia in patients with cirrhosis and the association with comorbidities to analyze the changes in Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores. Retrospective research was executed at “PSKUS” in “Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Therapy Center” from February 2020 to March 2020. The study included 54 patients with cirrhosis- 27 women (48.25%) and 28 men (51.75%) with average age of 49.93 years and a mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of 26.34 kg / m2.  By summarizing the data, it was recognized that the prevalence of dyslipidemia among patients with cirrhosis was high (from 35,2 to 77,8%). A moderately strong association was found in dyslipidemia characterized by reduced high-density lipoprotein levels (HDL). Patients with high BMI are more likely to have dyslipidemia with elevated cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein fraction.  The study did not confirm a statistically significant association between BMI and dyslipidemia in cirrhotic patients with DM (ρ=1,44 x10-2). However, data showed that patients with cirrhosis had a higher incidence (66.67%) of decreased serum HDL than patients without DM (23.08%). The association was close (V = 0.45). Only hypertriglyceridemia was associated with worsering of MELD 3-month mortality score.",0

972,"The master's thesis was designed to elucidate the relationship between self-efficacy, affective and social support and demographics of women with children, as well as differences in self-efficacy and social support between women who have or have not used a midwife during pregnancy and women who have one or two children. As part of the master's thesis, data was collected from 324 respondents with an average age of 29 years (SD = 4.74, 18 to 46 years). Of the surveyed respondents, 81.5% (n = 264) did not use the services of a contract midwife during pregnancy, 17.0% (n = 55) have used the services of a contract midwife and 1.5% (n = 5) of the respondents did not have information about such a service. A Six-item short of the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ6), Sarason, Sarason, Shearin & Pierce, 1987, was adapted to answer the questions of the study as part of the Master's work. The International Positive and Negative Affect Scale Short Form (I PANAS SF), Thomson, 2007), adapted by A. Upman (2010), was used. A general self-efficiency survey (General self-Efficacy Scale, Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) was used to study self-efficiency, the survey has been adapted by Bulina (Bulina, 2009) in Latvia. The results of the study show that women who have used the services of a midwife during pregnancy have a lower average social support received from family members (M = 1.71, SD = 1.05) compared to women who did not use the services of a midwife (M = 2, 12, SD = 0.98). The results show that there is a relationship that higher-income women will also have higher self-efficiency rates and a lower negative aptitude rate. Looking at the results of the study, it can be concluded that women who have given birth to their first child are more satisfied with childbirth support and also have a wider social support network in terms of the number of family members.",0
